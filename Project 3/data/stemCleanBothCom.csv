229,289,"they are exaggerating their powers, they are not allowed to force entry to domestic premises, that includes high court enforcement officers even if it is where someone works from home. the only ones who can force entry, in very very rare circumstances, often with the courts permission, are bailiffs collecting for a magistrates fine. i think that power has been used about 6 times in the last 4 years.   a removal of goods order is a specific legal document and as such they would have to have already been in and given you a controlled goods agreement.  the police are only there to stop a breach of the peace and as it is civil law they are unsure of bailiff powers. the best advice is to keep the door locked at all times.   if i had a pound for every time can't pay we'll take it away give out unlawful information about bailiff powers i'd probably have over £100.   they need you to let them in by moving out of their way to allow them in or to leave the door unlocked, they are allowed to try to the door and if it is unlocked they can walk in.   the thing that gives them the power to force entry is a controlled goods agreement (cga) and that should be an inventory of items they have taken under control. if you do not keep up with the payments they can come back to recover them, you, or another adult, have to sign the cga, if you don not it is not valid so you can refuse entry.  they are bailiffs and should show their id and if they don't you can refuse to allow them in anyway, they haven't identified themselves so i wouldn't let anyone in anyway in that scenario. you can also film them a lot of them will have body cameras and you can ask for that footage if you believe they haven't visited and have just posted the letter through your door.   i could go on but trust me they cannot force entry on their first visit to domestic premises.",1615993928,LegalAdviceUK,gr8sz7c

355,447,"nal.  this isn't strictly true.  as i understand it, the law requires you to notify dvla.  it doesn't require you to verify that they've bothered to process it - that's an administrative function totally independent of what the law requires.  dvla have a bit of a habit of conflating ""what the law requires"" and ""it'd make our life easier"" in their letters.",1615986419,LegalAdviceUK,gr8e7gg

365,458,"as u/spunkvolcano has said, it is a defence to a discrimination case to show that there is a legitimate aim: that you were discriminating between two groups not because you're a bigot, but because you have a purpose which is legitimate.  the test is not that the person accused of discrimination thinks it's a legitimate purpose, it's that a court actually agrees it's legitimate, which means in practice it also has to be real.  there are endless cases where this has been accepted as an argument, and it's pointless to trawl through them looking for analogies: it would be fact specific and for the court to decide.  i think it's highlyunlikely that you'd get far with this line of argument, because the legitimate purpose (preventing the spread of covid, and protecting people who are genuinely unable to receive vaccines), and the temporary nature of the issue (you will be vaccinated in a few months' time) means that the discrimination is likely to be found proportionate and reasonable as a way to achieve a legitimate aim.     someone could fight a testcase, but it would be expensive and uncertain.  there is a separate contractual issue of the holiday you've booked and paid for.   in principle a tour operator could claim force majure or frustration, but it's likely that either they or their insurer or your insurer will refund you or offer to rebook you once you have been vaccinated.  once you've been refunded, your discrimination case becomes even weaker.  someone thinking there's a compo bonanza in phoning up companies that are imposing vaccine obligations, being refused a booking and then angling for a discrimination case is likely to be very disappointed, too.",1615985897,LegalAdviceUK,gr8dbou

1323,1669," it looks like your post is about changing your name. some basic information that may answer your question is below:  * you do not need to enter into any legal process to go by a different name; you can simply start using the new name. there is no such thing as having a ""legal name"" in the uk. (this is if you are an adult - for children, the process is more complex, depending on the circumstances.)  * in law, your name can be anything you like, so long as it is not chosen to deceive and commit fraud. however, government agencies such as the passport office and dvla have restrictions on what they will register as a name (e.g. they will typically not accept names that are vulgar, blasphemous or offensive), so you should be careful to ensure your proposed new name will comply with these before changing it, or you may not be able to change your identity documents.  * to evidence your change of name (e.g. to banks or other businesses, or to obtain id in your new name) and to create a documentary link between the old and new name, you will need to have a deed poll. you can in most circumstances print your own deed poll, sign it and have it witnessed at home for free; further information and a generator for these can be found at http://www.freedeedpoll.org.uk, the uk government also provides guidance [here](https://www.gov.uk/change-name-deed-poll/make-an-adult-deed-poll).  * a correctly signed and witnessed deed poll should be sufficient to evidence your change of name to the satisfaction of most commercial and government entities. it is advisable to obtain new id in your new name.  * contrary to popular belief and what some organisations may tell you, you do not *need* to have the deed poll enrolled for it to be valid once signed and witnessed, although since it provides an incontrovertible proof of the change of your name, which may be useful, you can do so if you wish to for a nominal fee. some organisations may also insist on a deed poll being enrolled before they'll accept it. see [here](https://www.gov.uk/change-name-deed-poll/enrol-a-deed-poll-with-the-courts) for more information on the process to follow.  * **in scotland** - see [here](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/registration/recording-change-of-forename-and-surname-in-scotland)  * **in northern ireland** - see [here](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/recording-change-name)  *i am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/legaladviceuk) if you have any questions or concerns.*",1615895682,LegalAdviceUK,gr42tgt

1518,1892,"coercion is extremely difficult to prove.  you would need hard evidence that you are being threatened and even then the police could just decide its a civil issue and walk away.   it sounds like the real issue is your desire to leave home and that you are being financially co-erced to stay.  you are likely better off reporting that you have been threatened and do not wish to hand over your money (they are more likely to act on this) and then take steps yourself to protect your funds.    if you experience violence or the threat of violence, remove yourself from the situation immediately. try to pre-arrange somewhere to go with a friend or local shelter. make a plan, pack a bug-out bag.  (under those circumstances you would not be in breach of lockdown)  as a minor, your options are limited. perhaps a savings account that ties in your money until you reach 18.  if you were you open a new account and transfer funds digitally, that would likely raise no red flags. but large amounts of cash withdrawn  or deposited at the counter is another matter.  avoid hard assets that are easily stolen if you are going into the care system or onto the streets.

1612,1999,"&gt; if nana updates her will, how does this work once they have both passed away? does one will override the other? if nana dies first does it become invalid and grandad’s will becomes the leading document if that makes sense?  wills are stand-alone documents, they don't ""override"" each other.  when your nana her will will be executed at that point in time. once her property is passed on then the terms of her will don't generally control what happens to that property afterwards.  so if your nana dies and leaves everything to your grandad then when he dies everything is distributed according to his will.  however if your nana is looking to re-write her will then nothing says she *has* to continue to give everything to your grandad; she can re-write it so her property goes wherever she wants.  &gt; in a nutshell, i’m asking what can my mum do and not do in this situation?  there are 2 main lines of attack against a will.  option one is to attack the validity of the will overall. this can involve showing that there were procedural flaws in its creation (e.g. it wasn't correctly signed and witnessed) or that the testator (person making the will) lacked testamentary capacity (didn't know what they were doing).  if the will is made professionally it should be fairly proof against procedural defects. a lawyer should also consider the capacity of their client and if there are any doubts it's good practise to note evidence at the time the will is created which can be used later in the event of a challenge.  if a will is successfully invalidated then the fallback would be to any previous valid will or failing that the rules of intestacy.  option 2 is a claim under the inheritance (provision for family and dependants) act 1975. this can be used by someone who feels a will doesn't make ""reasonable provision"" for them to seek to obtain or increase a legacy. if your nana leaves 30% of her estate to your mum it's unlikely she would have much scope to succeed in such a claim.",1615878455,LegalAdviceUK,gr3l0fp

(this is if you are an adult - for children, the process is more complex, depending on the circumstances.)  * in law, your name can be anything you like, so long as it is not chosen to deceive and commit fraud. however, government agencies such as the passport office and dvla have restrictions on what they will register as a name (e.g. they will typically not accept names that are vulgar, blasphemous or offensive), so you should be careful to ensure your proposed new name will comply with these before changing it, or you may not be able to change your identity documents.  * to evidence your change of name (e.g. to banks or other businesses, or to obtain id in your new name) and to create a documentary link between the old and new name, you will need to have a deed poll. you can in most circumstances print your own deed poll, sign it and have it witnessed at home for free; further information and a generator for these can be found at http://www.freedeedpoll.org.uk, the uk government also provides guidance [here](https://www.gov.uk/change-name-deed-poll/make-an-adult-deed-poll).  * a correctly signed and witnessed deed poll should be sufficient to evidence your change of name to the satisfaction of most commercial and government entities. it is advisable to obtain new id in your new name.  * contrary to popular belief and what some organisations may tell you, you do not *need* to have the deed poll enrolled for it to be valid once signed and witnessed, although since it provides an incontrovertible proof of the change of your name, which may be useful, you can do so if you wish to for a nominal fee. some organisations may also insist on a deed poll being enrolled before they'll accept it. see [here](https://www.gov.uk/change-name-deed-poll/enrol-a-deed-poll-with-the-courts) for more information on the process to follow.  * **in scotland** - see [here](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/registration/recording-change-of-forename-and-surname-in-scotland)  * **in northern ireland** - see [here](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/recording-change-name)  *i am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/legaladviceuk) if you have any questions or concerns.*",1615864557,LegalAdviceUK,gr32wpi

1689,2101,"if you mean it went to criminal court, then yes, technically it is of course a crime to accuse someone of a crime that they absolutely didn't commit - perverting the course of justice.  however, there are a few things which need to be noted.  firstly, the police would have investigated the entire situation - so not just taken the allegation as true and charged your friend, but taken his account and investigated it. if it had been found that his wife has made an absolute, demonstrably false claim then he wouldn't have been charged and it would have been her dealt with for wasting police time or even perverting the course of justice.  the fact he was charged demonstrates it wasn't this clear cut, and that cps felt at the time of charging that there was at least a 51% chance of conviction.  at court, he may have produced a defence (i did do those things, but have a lawful reason as to why): for example yes i slapped her but only because she was attacking me with a knife, it was reasonable self defence. if he succeeded with a defence, then the allegation from the side wouldn't be seen as a false report, it's simply that the court have examined the full facts and decided his actions were justified. in this scenario then she didn't commit an offence by reporting the assault on her.  if his defence at court was ""this absolutely didn't happen and she's made the whole thing up"" then i can understand why you may think that a not guilty finding would suggest that she is a liar and should be dealt with, but that's not the case. in court, to be convicted you must be found guilty beyond reasonable doubt on the evidence presented. if the court think ""he probably did do it, but i'm not sure"" then the correct verdict is not guilty. due to this, a not guilty plea will not automatically lead to evidence of an attempt to pervert the course of justice by the complainant. which is good really, as otherwise who on earth would risk reporting anything.  so in all likelihood the scenario is that the police have already investigated the matter anyway, didn't find anything at the time of significance to suggest she was lying, and so a subsequent allegation is unlikely to go anywhere, unless new evidence could be produced to show that she had told a deliberate lie. so simply a complaint from you, presumably not adding anything new other than ""hey look, he was not guilty"" is never, ever going to meet that bar.",1615849632,LegalAdviceUK,gr2cl9c

(this is if you are an adult - for children, the process is more complex, depending on the circumstances.)  * in law, your name can be anything you like, so long as it is not chosen to deceive and commit fraud. however, government agencies such as the passport office and dvla have restrictions on what they will register as a name (e.g. they will typically not accept names that are vulgar, blasphemous or offensive), so you should be careful to ensure your proposed new name will comply with these before changing it, or you may not be able to change your identity documents.  * to evidence your change of name (e.g. to banks or other businesses, or to obtain id in your new name) and to create a documentary link between the old and new name, you will need to have a deed poll. you can in most circumstances print your own deed poll, sign it and have it witnessed at home for free; further information and a generator for these can be found at http://www.freedeedpoll.org.uk, the uk government also provides guidance [here](https://www.gov.uk/change-name-deed-poll/make-an-adult-deed-poll).  * a correctly signed and witnessed deed poll should be sufficient to evidence your change of name to the satisfaction of most commercial and government entities. it is advisable to obtain new id in your new name.  * contrary to popular belief and what some organisations may tell you, you do not *need* to have the deed poll enrolled for it to be valid once signed and witnessed, although since it provides an incontrovertible proof of the change of your name, which may be useful, you can do so if you wish to for a nominal fee. some organisations may also insist on a deed poll being enrolled before they'll accept it. see [here](https://www.gov.uk/change-name-deed-poll/enrol-a-deed-poll-with-the-courts) for more information on the process to follow.  * **in scotland** - see [here](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/registration/recording-change-of-forename-and-surname-in-scotland)  * **in northern ireland** - see [here](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/recording-change-name)  *i am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/legaladviceuk) if you have any questions or concerns.*",1615805181,LegalAdviceUK,gr003xp

2309,2863,"sure, i didn’t elaborate because i don’t think it’s actually helpful to you.  the picture constitutes personal data so the gdpr applies to the employer’s use of it.  as part of those obligations the employer needs to comply with the obligation to provide the privacy information listed in article 14 (usually done in a privacy notice, but may be in other ways).  if the employer has not provided that information then use of the picture is arguably unlawful.  also, the employer needs a “legal basis” under article 6 of the gdpr for processing the data, and given the circumstances the only one that could be applicable is “legitimate interests”.  to rely on this the employer needs to identify a “legitimate interest” to use the data, and then weigh that interest against any adverse impact on the data subject (your wife).  this analysis is highly contextual, but the fact that they are “private” pictures (by that i mean outside the context of work) and she is in a bikini would be factors against reliance on legitimate interests.  the legitimate interest relied on also needs to be described in the privacy notice.  it’s difficult to say without knowing the full picture, but the employers use of the data could arguably violate the gdpr.  the reason i say i don’t think this is helpful is because the fact is they already have the picture, and an arguable breach of data protection law isn’t going to impact the position from an employment law perspective.  from a data protection law perspective, one option would be to object to the processing of the image and/or request that they delete it on the basis that it is processed unlawfully.  i don’t think the employer would uphold that request, but it would put it down on record in a formal context from a data protection perspect",1615804765,LegalAdviceUK,gqzzoc9

2414,2985,"short answer: your former gm has no chance in hell.  long answer:  because the us and the uk are both members of the berne convention (an international convention on protecting the rights of authors and artists) then only the copyright law of the country of distribution applies which in this case would be the uk (which is handy since i'm only trained in uk law not us).  there are many different types of ip ownership but unless your former gm has taken out a trademark (which would never be granted unless something actually substantive had been created such as a book or module that was for sale) then the only one that would apply here is copyright.  before i go on i want to make one message crystal clear; the following paragraph is me indulging in theory and has nothing to do with your case. since the character was created and played by you, it is yours and therefore.none of this next paragraph applies to it. if you only want the applicable answer, skip the next paragraph.   copyright is, at least in the uk, exactly as it sounds; it is the right to make an exact copy of a complete, substantial and commerical work. making a completely and total copy of a work created and ownes by another is illegal. but in the uk it is not difficult at all for something to be declared substantially different. to quote the minimum standard for a unique work in the uk: there must be some ""skill, labour, and judgment"" that has gone into it. the only way copyright could, maybe, possibly, probably not but conceivably, be engaged is if you lifted the entirety campaign beat for beat and sold it as your own. even then i'd doubt a court would rule against you unless the original campaign had been trademarked or was being published as well, but as i said i'm just theorising here.  the substantive conclusion is this: nobody but the player has ownership over their characters unless the player agrees to give (or sell) those rights to another at some point alongside express permission to use them in a work to be sold, or if the player is playing an already trademarked character (i.e. if you had made your pc literally mickey mouse, identical in looks, personality and name, you might struggle getting a book about him published). you are the inventor of the character, they are yours to do with as you will. full stop.   you would not need to have made any substantive changes to the character as it is already yours. however since you have made changes, even if it was for some unlikely reason disputed who the creator was of the character as it originally was concieved it would still not matter because that is a substantially different character from the one you have now. you are ironclad, airtight and utterly legally in the clear.",1615782298,LegalAdviceUK,gqzbuyo

2728,3410,"you are in the space governed by [section 12](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1977/32/crossheading/uncollected-goods) of, and [schedule 1](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1977/32/schedule/1) to, the torts (interference with goods) act 1977.   she is the owner of the goods, but you have possession of them. that makes her a bailor and you a bailee. there are various rights and obligations which go along with that relationship. the most immediately important ones are that you must take reasonable care of the goods, and you must not do anything inconsistent with her rights as owner (such as destroying them, selling them, or throwing them away).   there is an exception to the rule i have just mentioned. that exception is in the 1977 act linked above. section 12 provides that in certain circumstances, you are empowered to sell the goods in question *and pay her the proceeds, less reasonable sale costs*.   in order to exercise that right, you need to give the appropriate notices. the first notice, to stay on the safe side, is a notice imposing on her a duty to collect the goods, under section 12(2) and paragraph 1 of schedule 1:  &gt; (1) for the purposes of section 12(1) a bailee may, in the circumstances specified in this part of this schedule, by notice given to the bailor impose on him an obligation to take delivery of the goods.  &gt; (2) the notice shall be in writing, and may be given either—  &gt;&gt; (a) by delivering it to the bailor, or  &gt;&gt; (b) by leaving it at his proper address, or  &gt;&gt; (c) by post.  &gt; (3) the notice shall—  &gt;&gt; (a) specify the name and address of the bailee, and give sufficient particulars of the goods and the address or place where they are held, and  &gt;&gt; (b) state that the goods are ready for delivery to the bailor, or where combined with a notice terminating the contract of bailment, will be ready for delivery when the contract is terminated, and  &gt;&gt; (c) specify the amount, if any, which is payable by the bailor to the bailee in respect of the goods and which became due before the giving of the notice.  the second notice is a notice of intention to sell the goods, under section 3(a) and part ii (paragraph 6) of schedule 1:  &gt; (1) a notice under section 12(3) shall—  &gt;&gt; (a) specify the name and address of the bailee, and give sufficient particulars of the goods and the address or place where they are held, and  &gt;&gt; (b) specify the date on or after which the bailee proposes to sell the goods, and  &gt;&gt; (c) specify the amount, if any, which is payable by the bailor to the bailee in respect of the goods, and which became due before the giving of the notice.  &gt; (2) the period between giving of the notice and the date specified in the notice as that on or after which the bailee proposes to exercise the power of sale shall be such as will afford the bailor a reasonable opportunity of taking delivery of the goods.  &gt; (3) if any amount is payable in respect of the goods by the bailor to the bailee, and become due before giving of the notice, the said period shall be not less than three months.  &gt; (4) the notice shall be in writing and shall be sent by post in a registered letter, or by the recorded delivery service.  in other words, it is a notice that you will sell the goods unless she collects them within a specified period (which must be a reasonable period).   you can combine the two notices *if* you comply with the more demanding delivery requirements in paragraph 6(4) of schedule 1.   if she fails to collect the goods within the time you have allowed, you are then entitled to sell the goods in accordance with section 12(3). for such a sale, section 12(5) applies:  &gt; a bailee exercising his powers under subsection (3) shall be liable to account to the bailor for the proceeds of sale, less any costs of sale, and—  &gt;&gt; (a) the account shall be taken on the footing that the bailee should have adopted the best method of sale reasonably available in the circumstances, and  &gt;&gt; (b) where subsection (3)(a) applies, any sum payable in respect of the goods by the bailor to the bailee which accrued due before the bailee gave notice of intention to sell the goods shall be deductible from the proceeds of sale.  there are unlikely to be any sums payable *in respect of the goods* by her to you. you would arguably be on shaky territory if you attempted to deduct unrelated sums she owes you.",1615737158,LegalAdviceUK,gqwmyc2

3021,3815,"i’m not sure you’ve really contradicted anything i’ve said as op’s question was about the potential for op being prosecuted criminally rather than anything to do with insurance and civil matters.  as the scooter will have no insurance op will be able to get the insurance to payout for damage to their vehicle but the effect on their insurance will be down to if the insurance can recoup the costs from the scooter rider.  that would be a civil matter rather than a criminal one, so the police/cps wouldn’t be involved. i doubt the scooter rider would try to start a civil claim against op unless they have severe injuries, and even if they did the odds of the winning would be small, but that would be dealt with by op’s insurance.   the police may however decide to prosecute the scooter rider but that would have no real effect on op’s situation. if (hypothetically speaking) op wasn’t being honest about their account then it’s possible they would face some kind of prosecution for a driving offence, but given the circumstances op described i agree it would be highly unlikely. it is best for op not to confuse matters by inadvertently admitting some kind of liability or making contact with the other party and potentially accidentally incriminating themselves in the process.",1615682843,LegalAdviceUK,gquq2q7

3224,4054," i took the time and trouble of giving you a detailed reply. they are not ripping you off. as a neutral person, i can tell you they have been fair to you.  i remembered when, on occasions,  i made some wrong judgements about people and i assumed they were trying to cheat me, but in fact i was wrong.     the landlord will not be a penny better off. the letting agency will earn a new commission (however they are providing a service for their labour).   all uk goods and services are subject to vat (most things include vat). there is no vat on certain things such as food. some businesses will still quote £xxx + vat.  many shops include the cost of vat. in the us, it is known as a sales tax.   they seem to be happy to let you break the contract, but they don't want to be worse off by doing.    \&gt;  isn’t showing people round properties literally their job? how is that a cost that i’m liable to cover?   an agent earns their commission by finding a tenant. whether they show it to one person or to a hundred people. if no one takes up the property, they don't get earn a penny. that is their pricing structure. no sale - no fee.  in my opinion, that model is better, then telling you to pay an upfront marketing fee and they still keep their fee even, if they dont find a successful person. at least, with this pricing structure you have only been asked for pay on success.   the country has been in lockdown since january. people have to stay at home.  office workers can work safely from home . however, certain class of workers have public facing roles and have to work as they are ""critical"" workers e.g. supermarket worker, doctors, nurses, chemists, delivery staff, bus drivers, postmen, petrol station, mechanics .....  and even letting agents!    all these people are putting themselves at risk for the benefit of keeping the country running. a supermarket worker is n't getting paid ""danger"" money for working in an environment where they can get covid.  people are worried about passing covid to their family members.  you want the letting agents to go out to do viewings for £0.00 and put themselves and their family at risk?.    \&gt;  like i said, i wasn’t informed that they lowered the advertised price nor was i informed at any point that i have to pay the difference, so if this has been done without my knowledge, how am i responsible for paying under ‘breach of contract’?      seriously?   to be blunt,  by making such an argument. the letting agents are probably fed up of you. they probably don't won't want to help you anymore (that is me reading between the lines). they have tried to do you a favour and you have made them feel like they are cheating you.    imagine a situation, where the rent is £950. the next month you decide you only want to pay £900. that is what you are asking of them to do by breaking the contract. it is going to cost them £300.  so how are they ""milking"" you? on the contrary the landlord and letting agent will be worse off, if they break the contract and accept a reduced rent.    i am sure the letting agents would have tried to get the best offer (they are on commission). however, if they found another student at £900 who is willing to take it today, then this is better to take this deal, rather then to wait  for an offer of £950, which may never come until next academic year.   i am guessing this is a student house and it is mid-term. how many students are looking for accommodation at this time?    they can't put a 60 year old bus driver in a student house. they need to find the right person.     \&gt;  i didn’t ‘choose not to use it’, i have quite literally been unable to, as have many other students from abroad.       explain.   i have a friends from spain who are studying in brighton and manchester. their want to enjoy university life and be with their friends.   they were aware of the expected difficulties of lockdown.  equally, i have read about students trying to get out of their contracts to save on housing cost.      \&gt;  the property is still marked as let agreed       no one can tell what has happened. may be the person who saw the property changed his mind. may be he saw a better house with another agent. may be that person has n't passed the referencing.  if this agency, had 3 other desperate students trying to get out of their contract, may be they decide to help them first, rather then help you.   in my viewpoint, (and reading between the lines). the agency feels you have wronged them. it is okay to ask for a breakdown for fees, but to accuse them of milking you, ripping you off..... you are wrong there.",1615667246,LegalAdviceUK,gqtygpi

3267,4099,"strictly speaking, yes, it is against the law, but you're not going to be prosecuted for it.  the offence committed is ""sexual activity with a child"", under section 9 of the sexual offences act 2003.  this offence is committed in this case because a person aged 18 or over, touched a person aged under 16, and the touching was sexual, and the adult did not reasonably believe that the child is over 16.  kissing is likely to be sexual touching - i think if it had been a platonic kiss on the cheek, you wouldn't be so worried about it.  if you believed she was 16 or over, then you've committed no crime.  **however**, the crown prosecution service (the government agency which prosecutes crimes) has guidance which says that where the offence is committed between young people of similar ages, and no coercion or exploitation is involved, then it will not be ""in the public interest"" to charge.  in this case, it seems there is no public interest in charging you.  in short: you have nothing to worry about, this isn't going to get prosecuted.  &gt;i have messaged her since (i'm 24 now and she's 20) and she said no harm was done and she doesn't care and i don't need to be sorry. however i still feel alot of guilt and i'm stuck in the past because of it.  it sounds like you have a lot of anxiety over this.  my strong advice to you would be:  don't pester her about this.  i'm concerned that you will have an urge to continually message her asking ""are you *sure* it's okay?  are you sure?  are you sure?""  and eventually that might turn into a different crime - harassment.  so probably best not to have any more contact with her unless she invites it.",1615665482,LegalAdviceUK,gqtv50j

3272,4104,"specific questions:  &gt;\- how % of the downpayment would be good to have? i'm thinking about £15,000, and then save a bit of money just in case some repairing is needed.  we call it a deposit (just to avoid any confusion).  there is no set rule but in general you want as big a deposit as possible to a) have a better chance of mortgage being agreed and b) get better interest rates.  anything from 5-10% is minimum really.  15-25% is good.  25%+ is great.  40%+ is normally where you get the best mortgage rates so often little value in going beyond this.  you will often need to prove where the money has come from as part of the legal paperwork later in the process.  the general rule of thumb is that lenders will go up to 4.5x your before-tax (gross) income.  if you have a particularly good deposit or have other risk-reducing factors (good solid job, etc) then they may go beyond this, with some pushing up to 6x.  this is where broker advice is very useful.  you can get a mortgage ""in principle"" at any point (many do this before even starting viewings), but you don't apply for a mortgage until you've offered on a place.    for the mortgage, you should go via a broker, many of whom are free to the consumer (they get their commission from the lender with no costs passed on to you).  if you think your status as a non-national might complicate things (e.g. poor credit record), you might want to consider more specialist brokers, who may charge a fee of £500-£1500.  so for your proposed situation:  £155,000 property price.  £15,000 deposit is ok (just under 10%) but a little more, say up to £20k would really help.  if you put down a £15k deposit you need a mortgage of £140,000, which means you generally need to be earning above £31,100 gross.  &amp;#x200b;  &gt;\- how much solicitor or all legal stuff might cost? i have no clue!  somewhere between £1000 and £3000, depending on complexity and what sort of solicitor/conveyancer you instruct and including cost of surveyors (which you'll often instruct separately).    &amp;#x200b;  &gt;\- i would like to ask for a discount on the price, how much would be appropriate (not offensive)?  it is normal to offer below asking price.  every seller has different motivations:  some want a quick sale, whereas some others might be willing to hold out for a high price.  offering 10% below is normal.  20% below is starting to push it and you may be seen as not serious.   if you offer below, you might often explain why.   &amp;#x200b;  &gt;\- what legal documents should i check about it?  legal stuff will all be dealt with by your solicitor/conveyancer.    &amp;#x200b;  about the process:  the process is long (months), complicated, and painful.  note that until stage 7, there is no legal or contractual obligation and either party can pull out or unilaterally change e.g. price for any reason.    1. buyer views property, and asks questions to the estate agent who will pass them to the seller.  seller may or may not be present during viewings.  at this stage there is no formal paperwork and it can be a pain to get important information as there is no legal requirement to provide full details at this stage. 2. if they like it, the buyer makes an offer.  seller considers.  there may be a period of price negotiation, and then seller accepts.  **nothing is legally binding at this point.**    3. buyer applies for a mortgage.  mortgage lender will instruct a valuing surveyor, consider the application, and come back with an answer in a few weeks.  most buyers should do this via a broker as it is usually free and has zero downsides.   4. after this or at same time, buyer selects and instructs a conveyancer and/or solicitor who deals with all of the paperwork, legal issues, local searches, etc.  this includes many steps and can take months.  seller will also instruct their own solicitor.   5. during this period the buyer (and often the seller) will usually employ their own surveyor to look at and value the property (and this will be more thorough than the mortgage survey which is often just a cursory check to make sure it's not a scam/fraud). 6. buyer will also use this period to find out more detail about the property, measure up for furniture, negotiate over what is and isn't included (e.g. are they leaving beyond appliances) etc.  all of this is done via the solicitors/conveyancers and estate agents, and there are various forms and paperwork that need to be completed.  you generally won't have direct contact between buyer and seller.  **still nothing is legally binding**. 7. buyer and seller may make further price negotiations, if e.g. surveyors have found problems that will need to be fixed or if the seller wants to try it on and try and extract a higher price (shitty move but not illegal). 8. when both parties are happy with the price and conditions, they will ""exchange contracts"".  this is when they sign the contract, and agree on a move-in date.  **this is the first point in the process where there is now a legal obligation and pulling out after this incur costs.**  9. the final part is **completion***,* which can be the same day as the exchange or a week or two later.  this is when you get the keys and move in.   10. there may be questions or new problems that arise after the sale (suddenly find out house is collapsing), which may result in legal claims.  *in general*, unless the seller has misled on any of the paperwork, the buyer buys a property ""caveat emptor"" aka ""buyer beware"":  it was their and their surveyor's responsibility to find faults before agreeing to the purchase.   again at this stage communication will still be through the solicitors and estate agents, rather than directly between buyer and seller.  the whole process can take months and is stressful for all parties involved; average seems to be 3ish months, but you hear of some sales taking upward of 9 maybe even longer than a year.  the biggest delaying factor is often if you have a chain, for example if the seller is also buying a new property - this makes things complicated as you often have to orchestrate a completion date on the same day on multiple properties all of the way up the chain.",1615665214,LegalAdviceUK,gqtun6w

3372,4232,"nal.  it is a ballache; let me explain broadly how it works (in order!):  1. you approach a mortgage broker and get what's called an ""agreement in principle"".  this means the bank is quite happy to loan you the money provided you meet all their other conditions.  be warned not all mortgages will let you rent out rooms, so you need to tell your broker you need a product that will let you do that.  you will usually be able to borrow anything from 3-5x your annual pre-tax salary and (depending on the amount of deposit) you may have to pay more interest.  your mortgage broker will want proof of income (usually payslips). 2. you find a house you like and make an offer.  nobody expects you to offer full asking price - 3-5% would not be an unusual amount to knock off.  you an always make a bigger offer if your first one is refused. 3. once it's agreed, you instruct a solicitor.  expect to pay \~£800 +vat and expenses.  houses are sold ""as seen"" in the uk; your solicitor will therefore spend some time checking basic things like ""is the house on top of an abandoned mineshaft?"" and ""does the person selling the house own it in the first place?"".      1. your solicitor will want proof of where your deposit is coming from (so they know you're not laundering money).  if you've been saving up for a few years, a bank statement proving it should suffice. 4. you'll also have to tell your mortgage company you've found the house you want and ask them to go ahead; they will instruct a surveyor.  the mortgage company's survey will be very basic: think ""is there actually a house there?"".  they will often offer you the option of a more extensive survey, though it will be rather dearer.  this survey will be carried out at your expense.  you will also have to pay any application fees for the mortgage at this stage. 5. several months later, you will exchange contracts.  your solicitor will talk you through what everything means, and will want your deposit before you can exchange contracts.      1. until such time as you have exchanged contracts, anyone can pull out of the transaction - only once exchanged is it legally binding.  ""completion"" (the day where money changes hands and you actually get the keys and can move in) usually takes place a couple of weeks after exchange.    2. around the time of exchange, your solicitor will want their fees paid.  british homes are usually not sold with basics like white goods (washing machine, fridge/freezer) or curtains - though you may be able to negotiate this as part of the buying process.  if you can't agree this, then you'll need to budget for it as soon as you move in.",1615655652,LegalAdviceUK,gqtccxv

3563,4460,"i think the application of a modicum of common sense would tell someone that laws differ from country to country, so where you are qualified isn’t simply an interesting biographical fact about where you studied.  from a practical point of view, (a) this practice is more or less universal, as far as i can tell, whereas one would have expected the sra to take steps if it were a criminal offence and (b) the fact of qualification in another jurisdiction is obviously relevant information which people should be permitted to communicate, and not be caught out by the (essentially arbitrary) fact that the role in the other jurisdiction is also called “solicitor”.   if we break the section down:  &gt; **unqualified person not to pretend to be a solicitor.**  &gt; any unqualified person who wilfully pretends to be, or takes or uses any name, title, addition or description implying that he is, qualified or recognised by law as qualified to act as a solicitor shall be guilty of an offence  so the two ways of committing the offence are:   * pretending to be (qualified etc) to act as a solicitor.   * taking on a name etc implying that you are.   the former just clearly isn’t made out, it seems to me: saying “i am an australian-qualified solicitor” just isn’t pretending to be a solicitor of the senior courts of england &amp; wales.   so you have to hang your hat on the latter – that you have taken or used a title or description *implying* that you are (or, at the very least, implying that you are qualified to act as one). again, objectively those words on their own don’t imply that, so you have to rely on a sort of general ignorance which just don’t think exists.   you mention op’s case, but if anything i think that proves my point: people don’t actually regularly look up *every* person using the word “solicitor”, and i doubt that’s what op did. he saw the words “australian qualified”, *realised* their import, and is now taking an essentially opportunistic point, when he hasn’t in fact been misled, and no reasonable person would have been misled, into thinking that this chap was a qualified english solicitor or entitled to as as one.",1615638151,LegalAdviceUK,gqsjxha

(i gave up some of my asset claims because she was being unreasonable, but it was not worth going to court over, so i get you giving up some money to do the right thing for your child.)  fourth, some lawyers do give a free hour consultation to see if there's a fit. it's not ok for it to be unclear about whether you're paying or not.  fifth, consider jointly hiring a lawyer as a mediator -- that gives you the ability to ask the mediator privately questions like, hey, what would i likely get in court on this issue, or is there a creative way to get me a fairer share of the equity without her having to move, or if i give her this equity in the house, how do i know she won't move in a year anyway?  so what to do? consider 1) telling your wife's attorney in writing that you need time to think about the deal, that she is not authorized to take you off the deed or do anything unusual with joint accounts until you do, 2) consider filing the complaint yourself, as that usually freezes things until there is an agreement, but that depends on your state, 3) either hire a lawyer or consider jointly hiring a lawyer as a mediator.  ianal, just my two cents. best luck. admire that you're putting the bigger picture, especially for your child, first.",1615997439,legaladvice,gr90t32

7384,8962,"your mind is going to the right place in thinking about ""unilateral"" changes, but there are a few important factors to consider.  1) if it is deemed illegal to unilaterally revert to the original terms after agreeing to the modification, what is the remedy for the landlord? it would not be termination, it would be a claim for the amount owed for the electricity. they would have to sue for it which would probably cost more than the ~$1000/year difference the tenant is refusing to pay in electricity.  2) the reason for the so-called ""modification"" is related to the power dynamic of the landlord-tenant relationship. fearing for their home security, the tenant agreed to something that was to their detriment. the landlord was the first one to state that they would not be abiding by the contract. **arguably, and in my opinion, this is not actually agreeing to a modification, this is a breach of contract by the landlord, and the tenant was coerced into accepting the cost of the beach.** both the first change and reverting back can be considered unilateral, but only one is supported by a written agreement. furthermore, you must again remember that the remedy is not termination, it would be to compel one party or the other to pay for the electricity, and most of the pressure here is on the landlord.  3) usually when a contract is modified, there must be new consideration (this is a contested area of law, i'm honestly not sure how this would go in maine). for the non-lawyers here, consideration is an element of a contract that goes along with the other elements of the offer and acceptance. usually consideration is money, but it generally just means some sort of advantage or benefit. so, in the original modification where the tenant says they'll pay the difference in the electric bill, what is the new consideration? there is none. the implied ""consideration"" is that the landlord won't evict them. the landlord is the one who is breaching. there is no fresh consideration in return for the tenant assenting to the landlord's refusal to abide by the contract and pay the electric bill.   4) again, *practically,* because decision-makers have an acute awareness of the power dynamic in the landlord-tenant relationship, any ambiguity regarding contract law here will likely be in favour of the tenant and the landlord will have to spend a lot of time and money making a legal claim for less than $1000 in alleged damages. they will not be looked upon favourably by a judge or arbitrator who knows that they are there because they made a bad deal for themselves and now they're mad that it's costing them.  landlord-tenant law is a unique area of law. it should not be viewed as something that will be dictated by the fundamental principals of contract. we're not talking about a multi-million dollar construction project, we're talking about a landlord who made a bad deal and tried to take advantage of their tenant. i've never heard of a landlord winning a case like this. more importantly, these things are usually not decided by the legal system, they are decided by both sides thinking about their non-legal options and making practical considerations to get what they want.",1615915450,legaladvice,gr56p9j

7679,9303,"first, you each need a will. generally, married couples appoint each other as primary executor. the surviving parent would get custody of the children, unless there is a big problem.   i am another who thinks paying for an attorney is money well spent. yes, the attorney may use boilerplate language, but it’s boilerplate that the attorney knows will keep the probate court happy.  there’s complexity in naming beneficiaries, an executor, and kids’ guardians. speaking of boilerplate, this is some of mine:  when the beneficiaries are minors, the court usually wants their inheritance put into a trust, so the guardian can’t run off with it. if you don’t provide for the trust, the court will. you may or may not want the guardian to also be the trustee—the trustee should be someone you trust to make good investment decisions. among other things, you can specify if the child will receive unspent trust funds at age 18, or maybe a few years later when they are more mature. you may want to put everything into a living trust instead.   you can use the will to nominate a guardian. i say “nominate” because it is not completely binding. ultimately, the court will decide, based on what is in the best interests of the child. it is rare that the court will go against the parents’ wishes, though.   you should nominate a primary and backup guardian. the primary may develop a medical condition that means they can no longer care for children. they may take up a new profession, such as buddhist monk or prison inmate. they may move to botswana. (you need a backup executor for the same reason.)  while you are setting up wills, you should also have the attorney prepare [advance directives](https://hhs.texas.gov/laws-regulations/forms/advance-directives). this names someone to make healthcare decisions for you if you are incapacitated and sets out your healthcare wishes, especially for life support and end-of-life decisions (this part is often called a “living will.”). you can, if you want, give your agent immediate authority. they can’t overrule your wishes as long as you are competent but it allows them to talk to healthcare providers without you needing to be present to give consent. for example, to pick up a prescription and talk to the pharmacist, or call an advice nurse for you. again you need a primary and backup agent. you can set it up so only your spouse has immediate rights.  you can also prepare a document that sets out your wishes for what the law calls “disposition of remains.”  funeral, burial/cremation, etc.    if you don’t have an advance directive or funeral document, the decision maker is set by law. it may not be the person you want.",1615909615,legaladvice,gr4tg74

[this](https://www.gob.mx/tramites/ficha/pasaporte-ordinario-para-personas-mayores-de-edad/sre112) is the official page of the mexican government which describes all the documents you need to get a passport and again, doesn’t say that you can’t get one because of the military service. however it’s required to have a mexican birth certificate or any other documents that prove you’re mexican.   overall, my suggestion is calling your airline and asking them about the required documents you might need to travel inside of mexico. i’ve always shown either my passport or id but since you don’t have any legal way to prove you’re mexican, things get complicated and you might not even be able to travel at all.  good luck!",1615887494,legaladvice,gr3toh9
