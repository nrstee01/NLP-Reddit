I think this case on its own in this context might give the slightly misleading impression that the validity of a marriage is somehow undermined if the parties do not intend a romantic or sexual relationship, with its references to loving one another as husband and wife.

106,131,"In that case, if signed off properly by the registrars, that looks to be a ceremony that gives rise to a legally binding marriage, and there was an intent to go through with it.  Unfortunately it does not look like it will give rise to a non-marriage - your own attack here is on incapacity to marry, but that gives rise only to a voidable marriage, and a decree of nullity in respect of a voidable marriage still allows for financial remedy proceedings.  However, the test for capacity to marry is not an onerous one.  In customary succinctness, the essential questions are, as per [Sheffield City Council v E &amp; Anor [2004] EWHC 2808 (Fam)](https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Fam/2004/2808.html):  Munby J as he then was:  &gt; That said, **the contract of marriage is in essence a simple one, which does not require a high degree of intelligence to comprehend. The contract of marriage can readily be understood by anyone of normal intelligence.**  &gt; ix) There are thus, in essence, two aspects to the inquiry whether someone has capacity to marry.   &gt; **(1) Does he or she understand the nature of the marriage contract?**  &gt; **(2) Does he or she understand the duties and responsibilities that normally attach to marriage?**  There are numerous authorities on the point, but shortly, the two questions are often elided - to understand the nature of the marriage contract leads you to understand what those duties and responsibilities are.  In general, they are:  &gt;  The duties and responsibilities that normally attach to marriage can be summarised as follows: **Marriage, whether civil or religious, is a contract, formally entered into.**  &gt; **It confers on the parties the status of husband and wife, the essence of the contract being an agreement between a man and a woman to live together, and to love one another as husband and wife, to the exclusion of all others. It creates a relationship of mutual and reciprocal obligations, typically involving the sharing of a common home and a common domestic life and the right to enjoy each other's society, comfort and assistance.**  (obviously that now includes same sex marriages).  Can it be said that you understood *that* was what you were signing up for? It is not about the consequences that could result from *your* marriage, rather it is about your understanding what the nature of marriage (in our law) is.  It is not a dry question of legal obligations and duties - what is meant by this is, did you understand the *expectations* of what a marriage is supposed to be?   If you lacked that understanding - and often these cases involve expert evidence - then it would be voidable and you could annul it rather than get divorced.  But the bar is not high:  &gt; There are many people in our society who may be of limited or borderline capacity but whose lives are immensely enriched by marriage. We must be careful not to set the test of capacity to marry too high, lest it operate as an unfair, unnecessary and indeed discriminatory bar against the mentally disabled.  &gt; Equally, we must be careful not to impose so stringent a test of capacity to marry that it becomes too easy to challenge the validity of what appear on the surface to be regular and seemingly valid marriages.  In any case if your fear is financial proceedings, then it's too late I'm afraid.",1616878632,LegalAdviceUK,gsi9w2j

229,289,"They are exaggerating their powers, they are not allowed to force entry to domestic premises, that includes High Court Enforcement Officers even if it is where someone works from home. The only ones who can force entry, in very very rare circumstances, often with the courts permission, are bailiffs collecting for a magistrates fine. I think that power has been used about 6 times in the last 4 years.   A removal of goods order is a specific legal document and as such they would have to have already been in and given you a controlled goods agreement.  The police are only there to stop a breach of the peace and as it is civil law they are unsure of bailiff powers. The best advice is to keep the door locked at all times.   If I had a pound for every time Can't Pay We'll Take It Away give out unlawful information about bailiff powers I'd probably have over £100.   They need you to let them in by moving out of their way to allow them in or to leave the door unlocked, they are allowed to try to the door and if it is unlocked they can walk in.   The thing that gives them the power to force entry is a controlled goods agreement (CGA) and that should be an inventory of items they have taken under control. If you do not keep up with the payments they can come back to recover them, you, or another adult, have to sign the CGA, if you don not it is not valid so you can refuse entry.  They are bailiffs and should show their ID and if they don't you can refuse to allow them in anyway, they haven't identified themselves so I wouldn't let anyone in anyway in that scenario. You can also film them a lot of them will have body cameras and you can ask for that footage if you believe they haven't visited and have just posted the letter through your door.

This in turns into a feedback loop, where they get rusty at repairing boilers, because they spend more time fitting them then looking at the  internal mechanics of boilers.    British Gas had done this to many friends, they recommend replacing a boiler rather then repairing it.   This is a consumer protection issue. On the Gas Safe website, they should publish metrics about how many boilers they successfully repair. How often they keep their appointment, how often they recommend replacing a boiler  etc...

Not specifically, but essentially yes, you are required to work extra hours to meet the needs of the business.  &gt; What does ""Reasonable"" mean in terms of contractual law?  Contract = will depend on what the parties intended. Employment = probably not so many extra hours that you do not get the prescribed rest breaks between shifts.   &gt; Would refusal to participate be acceptable grounds for sanctions or negative performance reviews?

309,392,"Is it possible that this is due to the nature of your condition(s)? I moved well outside my GPs catchment area several years ago and was advised that even though existing rules dictate that I should register with a new, more local practice, it was better that I stay with my existing practice as I had such a long and complicated medical history that it would be very difficult for a new GP to understand the ins and outs of my health, meaning the service they'd provide would be poorer than if I stuck with my existing practice. Although relatively inconvenient when I do need to stop by the practice as I don't drive but have to take a long bus to/from there, its worked really well otherwise as they basically change my prescriptions/add new things the second I ask for it without needing to see me or pour through my history to see if OK as they already know me. Not saying this is definitely the case, just that it may have been taken into consideration when you first requested to move. If you are unhappy overall though, you should definitely make a complaint",1615988184,LegalAdviceUK,gr8he2x

You seem very opposed to this but if you’re considering pressing charges over what seems to be 10 haters due to it causing you significant emotional distress and as you say “they just come back”, it doesn’t really make sense to keep the account. Not sure what type of writer you are, but there are other platforms that might serve you better.

343,431,"Whilst I’d love to give you examples of what you can do to try and get your money back, in reality there’s usually very little you can do about this sort of thing and for these sorts of monetary values (don’t get me wrong we would all love an extra £80 right now) it can very quickly cost more to attempt to do anything. It’s a sorry state of affairs but it is where we are.

346,435,"Kinda, yeah, but it's a bit irrelevant as you need to someway to prove / confirm that you have notified the DVLA. The *only* way to confirm this is to have received the letter back from them. This is what the DVLA do wheneve they receive the VC5.  If you do not receive the letter you have no evidence that you notified them. Maybe you sent a letter, but maybe it got lost in the mail. That's your problem, not theirs. Maybe it got to the DVLA and they lost it, you'll never know, it's your problem not theirs.  So you need that letter otherwise you can't prove anything whatsoever.  I sent a VC5, didn't receive a letter back (once you send these things you tick it off as done, forget, and move on). I then got a car tax notice. I appealed to the DVLA, it got rejected, I then escalated it, got rejected, and escalated it again, rejected again.

Also I don’t really have the £1000 (1st rent + deposit) it would require to move to a new property.

355,447,"NAL.  This isn't strictly true.  As I understand it, the law requires you to notify DVLA.  It doesn't require you to verify that they've bothered to process it - that's an administrative function totally independent of what the law requires.

The landlords obligations do not arise until he becomes aware that works or repairs are necessary. The landlord complies with his obligations if the carries out the necessary works or repairs within a reasonable time after the day on which he becomes aware they were necessary.”  It doesn’t specify what is a “reasonable time”. But I’ve notified them and it being winter, my flat being in an attic and it dropping to -1 at night, I don’t think they’ve resolved this “within reasonable time”.

It's trivially true that all tax is a matter of statutory construction, but it's clearly a better course of action to ask a personal finance forum about how to e.g. set up and register for Self Assessment, than ask a legal advice sub. We have accountants who advise on tax issues, even though tax is mostly a matter of pure law.  OP is also asking: ""is there a good place to look up what my rate should be?"" - that's a question about market practice and the value of OP's work, not a legal question at all.",1615986117,LegalAdviceUK,gr8dp5s

365,458,"As u/SpunkVolcano has said, it is a defence to a discrimination case to show that there is a legitimate aim: that you were discriminating between two groups not because you're a bigot, but because you have a purpose which is legitimate.  The test is not that the person accused of discrimination thinks it's a legitimate purpose, it's that a court actually agrees it's legitimate, which means in practice it also has to be real.  There are endless cases where this has been accepted as an argument, and it's pointless to trawl through them looking for analogies: it would be fact specific and for the court to decide.  I think it's highlyunlikely that you'd get far with this line of argument, because the legitimate purpose (preventing the spread of Covid, and protecting people who are genuinely unable to receive vaccines), and the temporary nature of the issue (you will be vaccinated in a few months' time) means that the discrimination is likely to be found proportionate and reasonable as a way to achieve a legitimate aim.     Someone could fight a testcase, but it would be expensive and uncertain.  There is a separate contractual issue of the holiday you've booked and paid for.   In principle a tour operator could claim force majure or frustration, but it's likely that either they or their insurer or your insurer will refund you or offer to rebook you once you have been vaccinated.  Once you've been refunded, your discrimination case becomes even weaker.  Someone thinking there's a compo bonanza in phoning up companies that are imposing vaccine obligations, being refused a booking and then angling for a discrimination case is likely to be very disappointed, too.",1615985897,LegalAdviceUK,gr8dbou

That figure shows a clear lack of understanding of how infringement cases play out.  If you want to make a counter offer to the figure that have asked for then feel free.

If You used their image without permission then they can cheaply and easily sue through IPEC - the Intellectual Property Enterprise Court. It is basically small claims court for infringement. I would expect any award to be in the thousands.  2. Unless the image is actually available on Getty then their price for something similar is irrelevant. The court will value the image at the amount it would cost you to hire a photographer to shoot that image and then they will add on a bunch of extra costs.  3. The fact that you took the image down is irrelevant. The offence has already occurred. While you aren't making it worse you aren't making it better either.  4. The fact that someone you hired was responsible (and you say you didn't know) makes this an innocent infringement.... but it is still an infringement. This does not mean the court is going to come up with a figure that is lower than the cost of a license and/or the value mentioned above (plus extra costs). You are liable for the actions of your employees or others you hire. On the plus side you can sue the web agency to recover your losses.   You have three options here (after asking for proof) ....  1. Settle for the amount asked for. 2. Make a lower counter offer. 3.

Mould is a tricky one, it may be connected with the roof (e..g leaky guttering). It may also be down to the way the property is lived in. Ventilation is key. Once mould is growing, it keeps multiplying. It is worth buying a humidify meter. Keeping the property ventilated, to let moisture out.

No, that section of the CPR means that there is an obligation to help you with legal terminology, jargon and procedure.

I mean this in the best possible way when I say that you stand a better chance with the nation's cheapest drink drive lawyer than you do on your own.

It is a strict liability offence, so being a little bit over will not be a defence. If however you had plead guilty at earliest opportunity and ask for a drink drive awareness course, provided this is your first offence you would have been given an 8 month ban and at most a £150 fine.

895,1122,IP queries on here tend to be a bit too complicated for a simple explanation. I didn’t mean to knock anything you wrote but there is often a lot of misinformation on IP.  There was one other point I thought was a bit odd - your comment on the GM registering a trade mark. You can apply to register a trade mark and not use it for 5 years in the UK - there is no need for a substantive creation. I could file to register ‘djdudnsisbdishd’ tomorrow for a range of goods/services and it would be registered within 3 months. Although I do wonder what exactly OP or GM would register. A character’s name could presumably be changed easily unless it was so strongly linked to the character and their attributes or a key plot point.  Anyway it sounds like you enjoy a spot of IP and I think we’re in agreement that the courts will remove elements of the EU’s influence on IP law - hopefully there will be a move back to more certainty.,1615921315,LegalAdviceUK,gr5jwee

None, tbh. You don't know who did it, and the sites aren't going to tell you. You can call the police on 101 about it, but simply leaking your photos isn't a crime; it'd be copyright infringement, a civil matter. That's if you even own the copyright, since someone else took the photos.  It'd be a crime if it was revenge porn, but it has a pretty narrow definition; the photos have to have been released without your permission, and with the express intention of causing you distress. Since the person who leaked them doesn't appear to have contacted friends and family, or you, to taunt you or expose you, it might be difficult to claim that there was intent. That they've been leaked with your name and your town lends more weight to that claim, but I'm not sure it'd go anywhere as it is.

Someone might come along with a real life example for you though!  Proceedings can be issued late if an injury only becomes apparent years later (things like miners with lung diseases or asbestos related illnesses where someone was working with asbestos before it became more controlled) so I suppose there could be a case where someone suffered an injury in an accident but didn't realise anything was wrong and then years down the line something else happens and triggers the old injury.

A rabbit in a hutch may make it hard for an immediate neighbour to establish interest, much less one at the opposite end of the street, but keeping a menagerie would make that more likely.

1004,1266,"The short: Read your contract and it's policy on AL.  This is why some businesses look at employees as just that and not individuals. So long as minimum staff requirements are met, it should be dealt on a first come first served basis, the business shouldn't look at reasons for leave and should respect the privacy of individuals outside of work. You're the employees, not the kids or the husband/wives. Anyone not employed by the company are or no concern to the business and should not influence decisions. We are all individuals we all have our own independent needs outside of work, be it a kid, dog, cat, partner, elderly parent or simply needing time to ourselves.  If the parents are desperate businesses are legally obligated to allow parents to take off 18 weeks of unpaid Parental leave for each child up until their 18th birthday, however only upto 4 weeks can be taken off each year. In this case PL is different to AL and your AL request maybe denied if a PL request is already been made. Maternity Leave and Paternatity Leave are similar in that regard. However if your boss has two AL request and decides to give it to someone based on their parental status I'd consider that indirect discrimination especially when there are other types of leave in place that an employed parent could take.  Some of the protected characteristics that come into play with dealing with a situation like this are, Age: 25-28 are the most likely to have new borns anyone below or older workers whose kids are above the age of 18 may feel discriminated against based on how old/young they are. Sex: Male employees are often discriminated against Female employees when it comes to leave due to the systemic sexism and stone age ideals that identifies men as providers and women as carers making some employers favour a woman's time off to care for kids over a man. Disability: You mentioned you are unable to have kids. Religion: Maybe reglious people deny sex before marriage, if you're young and single, then you're not going to have children and denying you AL could be seen as taking advantage of your beliefs. Sexual Orientation: although adoption, fostering and using a surrogate are options, maybe LGBTQ+ Couples don't have children due to the inability of being able to make a child directly with your partner.",1615910331,LegalAdviceUK,gr4v2ce

1040,1322,"So section 2 is for assessment and treatment and is very common. It is for 28 days and is often reviewed before then or allowed to lapse. It may become section 3 which is up to 6 months, again this does not mean it will last for 6 months. It will be reviewed regularly and may be rescinded as soon as she is assessed as no longer requiring to be held and treated without her consent. . However, be aware that if she does become informal she is entitled to discharge herself. She can also request for her section to be reviewed at set intervals.   In my experience the substance abuse may actually mean she is discharged sooner, especially if she continues to use or brings drugs/ alcohol onto the ward.   It is also important to know that people who are sectioned are allowed leave as they improve and infact are encouraged to do so, sometimes supervised and sometimes not. . She will need somewhere to go to take that leave.   ( I am not a lawyer, I was an Occupational Therapist specialising in Mental Health.)

On the face of it you would be (are) eligible for compensation for the injuries and distress caused to you, *and of course the 'lost' 7 hours you have suffered*.   You should perhaps consider informally asking your Employer how they would like you to proceed (if indeed you were to proceed), perhaps they'd prefer you to make a claim to [CICA](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/criminal-injuries-compensation-a-guide#what-is-the-criminal-injuries-compensation-scheme), or consult a no-win-no-fee lawyer.",1615905872,LegalAdviceUK,gr4l8tk

He's initially claimed £290, and we feel it should be £80 - £100 instead so would want to dispute the claim. So we wouldn't have any agreement, only that he initially claimed more.  Secondly, in the FAQs it mentions that we should get a check out inventory. What would count as this? I believe the landlord has taken photos of the property once we've moved out, but these haven't been shared with us. We've got a list of jobs that the landlord wanted doing, but these are from an ""interim check"" rather than a check out inventory. We never met with him when we were moving out, at his instruction we posted the keys through the letterbox.  Lastly, how does the idea of betterment work with a cleaner?

Now some humans have decided that he isn't going to do that anymore, with seemingly little thought as to what the cat might want.

I don’t think suggesting that you are tested only when/if you present with symptoms will do anything for your case especially as right now you would be expected to not go to work and organise a test if you had symptoms.

1067,1359,"1. Certainly contacting a lawyer wouldn't hurt, although if you go for interview you can ask for the duty solicitor for free, so bear that in mind. 2. You can choose whether to, but if the police are aware you're in the country, they may choose to arrest you if you don't.  I don't think it very likely that they would seek to have you returned to the UK unless they had a very strong case, which is unlikely with a historic offence. 3. They speak to those involved, victim, witnesses, alleged offender; and gather any information they can about whereabouts, activity, often from digital devices, and online histories, bank usage etc. For example, they may try and find data for where ATM withdrawls, card payments, etc were made to either place you at the scene, or show that you were likely not nearby. 4. Statistically speaking, no - backlog for digital forensics is high, court backlogs are long, and the police are overworked.  Many rape cases will see the alleger withdraw their support for the case after it drags on a bit.  Even a report of a rape yesterday will likely take a long while to investigate, and this both increases the chance of the complainant withdrawing, and of it ultimately going nowhere.  Statisically, most rape complaints do not lead to conviction.  This is not good, because a lot of it comes down to the massive amount of time it can take at the moment.

Your local PALS will also offer guidance.  If that process concludes in a matter which you find unsatisfactory, you can consult a medical negligence specialist solicitor.  For a claim to be successful, you would need to show that, given the same information at the same time, a majority of doctors would have not made the same error and that appropriate guidelines were not followed. Remember that negligence is more than an error.

1144,1462,"To clarify - your friend had an argument but then damaged the car without the owner present? I'm trying to establish the chances that the other party has your friends details.  It's a difficult one, for a few reasons:  * If the other party and police can't locate your friend, then essentially nothing will happen * If they can, it's better to have admitted it and attempted to make amends first * Even if your friend owns up to it, and makes it good, or even exceeds that, and compensates for more than loss, that doesn't guarantee any particular outcome if they are charged with criminal damage.  Legally speaking, your friend can't address the issue without risking a charge of criminal damage, and obviously morally speaking, they shouldn't even try to avoid it.  So, really, it's a matter of your friend being aware of the pros and cons of each course of action, and making their own decision - I'm avoiding being judgemental here:  1. Don't say anything, but run the risk that they will face charges if found, and the outcome would be likely worse than if they hadn't come forward 2. Say something, hoping that they can settle it privately, but with every chance that they can't, and accept the risk that they could end up with criminal record.  It's likely that if your friend has no previous criminal history, and approaches the police, that the outcome would be more lenient that if they say nothing and hope not to be caught - but that's not a given, not required, and no guarantees could be made, even if the person whose car was damaged tells the police that they don't want any action taken.

Make sure you use the words ""vulnerable"" and ""financial abuse"".  Take out enough cash to survive this next period of time, and then explain that you would like to make arrangements to not allow any withdrawals whatsoever. tell them to shut down you internet banking and your mobile banking. Ask them to block your account from re-registering for these services.  This then means you can only withdraw money at a bank. Tell them that if you come into branch with anyone at all, that they are to deny you access and call the police. The banks have an agreement with the police called Banking Protocol which means the police will attend.

That you instructed another firm to do the website does not absolve you of liability (although may drop the amount of any flagrancy damages that might be awarded).  For instance, a similar situation occurred in [ALAN MACKIE AGAINST MAXI CONSTRUCTION LTD [2017] SC LIV 11](https://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/search-judgments/judgment?id=cb5b2ca7-8980-69d2-b500-ff0000d74aa7) - Alan Mackie is a photographer who likes to pursue these kinds of claims religiously.  Here a company had made a website and they unknowingly used one of his photos. They tried to argue innocent use but:  &gt; **First, the onus is on the defenders to prove their lack of knowledge, and the defenders’ chairman had a very limited knowledge of how the photograph came into the hands, and what the marketing director knew of it.** The defenders did not call their marketing director to elucidate on the position further, for example to confirm how the photograph came into her possession and what she knew of its provenance, and there is therefore very little evidence put before me to allow me to conclude that the defenders simply did not know that the photograph was, or might be, subject to copyright.  All of that makes it difficult for the innocent use defence to be established. **Secondly, as I understand it, the innocent use defence is construed quite narrowly, and a perusal of the textbooks suggests that the view has often been taken in the courts that no person has a right to assume, without enquiry, that a photograph, or similar artistic work, given to them is without copyright protection.**  &gt;  I have taken into account the evidence of Mr Atkinson which effectively was that there was innocent use, and the fact that the photograph itself did not have the word “copyright” on it at any place (that only appearing in small print on the pursuers website).  **However, I think it is very difficult for the defenders as a commercial firm who themselves claim copyright in relation to photographs and other information appearing on their own website, to establish that they had no reason to believe that copyright subsisted in the photograph, and that their use was therefore innocent.  They have not shown that they carried out any enquiries into the provenance of the photograph, or gave sufficient thought to the question of whether it might be the subject of copyright.**  The pursuer needs to answer:  * Did the pursuer take the photograph   * Was the photograph used by the defenders * Did the defenders put the photograph on their website   However, you may find the factors relevant to damages to be useful, at [47]:  &gt; [47]      Finally, I note that the pursuer’s email of 17 November 2015 to the defenders, which contained the initial intimation of his claim that they were infringing his copyright, was extremely aggressive in its terms. He categorised the defenders’ actions as “utterly inexcusable” and immediately sought payment of damages at his full licence rate for a period of seven years. The email did not allow in any real way for the possibility that the defender’s use of the photograph might have been innocent, thus preventing any claim for damages. The whole thrust of the letter was an aggressive claim for damages, combined with the threat of legal action. **I consider that such an aggressive stance by the pursuer at a time when he could have no knowledge of whether the defenders had an innocent explanation for the use of the photograph was an unreasonable approach, and that it is a factor to which I am entitled to have regard in assessing damages.**  If you did infringe, the damages should be what it would have cost to licence the photograph for the period in question. A random photo on you page with no real special bearing - a stock photo you could have used for anyone?

It doesn't speak to anything about what the car might need in terms of service items, brake disc or pad usage, replacement tyres or anything else. It is entirely and utterly separate from the manufacturer-led servicing you need to have done to keep any vehicle roadworthy, safe and running properly.  The MOT test for brake pads and discs is binary, it's pass or fail. They will give you an advisory if it is close to passing or failing, but all it does is say yes or no to passing.

Beyond that, absolutely everything else to do with that car is down to YOU to keep on top of as the owner. But you're not an expert, Volvo is, that's why you take the car for an annual service and they'll check it over and see what needs to be done.   In the same way as having a house valued for a mortgage simply says to the bank 'yes we'll lend on this' but it's your responsiblity to have a structural and electric survey done, and to rectify any work.  An MOT is simply an annual check to see if that car is driveable that day. All that other work doesn't get identified at an MOT as that's not what it's for.

Are you saying this because you often don't find any actual incident/accident/anything at all near to the reduced speed area?  FYI, those limits are often put in place for traffic management, i.e. they want you to go slow where you are so there is less traffic arriving somewhere congested or with an incident further ahead (sometimes much further) and jams are therefore avoided. The very fact you don't find anything of note means it's working!  Regardless, they're legal limits (and red crosses up there are legal red lights, so although you see a lot going through those, that's running a red, should you get caught). It's not a defence not to know the reason a restriction is in place (and so ignore it).

1323,1669," It looks like your post is about changing your name. Some basic information that may answer your question is below:  * You do not need to enter into any legal process to go by a different name; you can simply start using the new name. There is no such thing as having a ""legal name"" in the UK. (This is if you are an adult - for children, the process is more complex, depending on the circumstances.)  * In law, your name can be anything you like, so long as it is not chosen to deceive and commit fraud. However, government agencies such as the Passport Office and DVLA have restrictions on what they will register as a name (e.g. they will typically not accept names that are vulgar, blasphemous or offensive), so you should be careful to ensure your proposed new name will comply with these before changing it, or you may not be able to change your identity documents.  * To evidence your change of name (e.g. to banks or other businesses, or to obtain ID in your new name) and to create a documentary link between the old and new name, you will need to have a deed poll. You can in most circumstances print your own deed poll, sign it and have it witnessed at home for free; further information and a generator for these can be found at http://www.freedeedpoll.org.uk, the UK government also provides guidance [here](https://www.gov.uk/change-name-deed-poll/make-an-adult-deed-poll).  * A correctly signed and witnessed deed poll should be sufficient to evidence your change of name to the satisfaction of most commercial and government entities. It is advisable to obtain new ID in your new name.  * Contrary to popular belief and what some organisations may tell you, you do not *need* to have the deed poll enrolled for it to be valid once signed and witnessed, although since it provides an incontrovertible proof of the change of your name, which may be useful, you can do so if you wish to for a nominal fee. Some organisations may also insist on a deed poll being enrolled before they'll accept it. See [here](https://www.gov.uk/change-name-deed-poll/enrol-a-deed-poll-with-the-courts) for more information on the process to follow.  * **In Scotland** - see [here](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/registration/recording-change-of-forename-and-surname-in-scotland)  * **In Northern Ireland** - see [here](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/recording-change-name)  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Bear in mind that this might result in them calling the police if their findings are that you are being coerced and are in any way unsafe though.  To elaborate further on getting the money back if you send it willingly - payment recalls rely on the funds still being available in the other account, and unless you claim you were being scammed, the other party is asked if they want to return the funds to you.   As to your question about whether the automated fraud detection will stop your payment based on your account activity - possibly. Maybe even probably, but it's not worth risking your life savings over, and even if it does stop it, it's possible that that will only delay the transaction.

However, fortunately your grandmother is remedying this mistake!  &gt;So my question is this, if Nana updates her Will, how does this work once they have both passed away? Does one Will override the other? If Nana dies first does it become invalid and Grandad’s Will becomes the leading document if that makes sense?  If your grandmother passed away first without updating her will, her whole estate would pass to your grandfather. However, while she is alive she can write a new will. The 'mirror' bit is not set in stone. I would recommend destroying the original will and having a new one drafted by a solicitor.  &gt;My concern is she will try to pressure Nana out of leaving Dad money, and if she’s unsuccessful with that, she will try to find some way to meddle with the Will either before or after Nana dies. In a nutshell, I’m asking what can my Mum do and not do in this situation?  It would be up to you or your family to prevent your mother from influencing your grandmother. Obviously your grandmother should not appoint your mother executor. The actual will document can probably be lodged with the solicitor who drafted it.  After your grandmother passes, there's a possibility that your mother could contest the will. Having it drafted properly by a solicitor would go a long way to preventing a successful claim. Such actions are very difficult to win anyway and all such litigation takes years and costs many thousands of pounds. The other possibility is that your mother makes a claim under [the 1975 Act.](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1975/63) The fact that she's already been left nearly a third of the estate would seem to say that such a claim has a very low chance of success.

1518,1892,"Coercion is extremely difficult to prove.  you would need hard evidence that you are being threatened and even then the police could just decide its a civil issue and walk away.   It sounds like the real issue is your desire to leave home and that you are being financially co-erced to stay.  You are likely better off reporting that you have been threatened and do not wish to hand over your money (they are more likely to act on this) and then take steps yourself to protect your funds.    If you experience violence or the threat of violence, remove yourself from the situation immediately. Try to pre-arrange somewhere to go with a friend or local shelter. make a plan, pack a bug-out bag.  (under those circumstances you would not be in breach of lockdown)  As a minor, your options are limited. Perhaps a savings account that ties in your money until you reach 18.  If you were you open a new account and transfer funds digitally, that would likely raise no red flags. but large amounts of cash withdrawn  or deposited at the counter is another matter.  Avoid hard assets that are easily stolen if you are going into the care system or onto the streets.

These only concern British citizens living in the EU, but might affect those living outside depending on outcome.  The basic argument for British citizens keeping EU citizenship is that the wording of the tfeu makes every citizen of a member country an EU citizen. It then states that EU citizenship is a 'fundamental status' not affected by national considerations. This creates a requirement that loss of this status must be proportional and requires due (EU not national) process. This view is supported by case law.  The argument in the other way is that if being a citizen of a member state makes you a citizen, then your country leaving means you lose that status. This is a more plain reading of the treaty, and has some logical merit.  We'll see where the ECJ lands.",1615886413,LegalAdviceUK,gr3snne
1529,1904,"I've looked at universal credit and housing benefit and it doesn't seem like I'd get very much for it. I think you lose £1 for every £250 in saving over £6k (iirc, it was something like that) and you lose something like 80p for every £1 you earn, my income would be partly from a part time job earning £500 a month and partly from freelance web development which usually nets me about £200-300 a month, so assuming £750 a month and £9k in savings the benefits I do end up with (based on benefit calculators I've used) would probably be pretty negligible. My form tutor was calling my social worker basically all day yesterday and ended up sending her an email since she couldn't get through to her so I assume I wouldn't have much luck in contacting her either. I know having savings would put me in a much better position than most but I always feel really anxious when it comes to big decisions like this and I've been losing sleep over the idea of having to support myself even with my savings.

If you're some sort of model that could harm your career.  You also don't have to reveal a name for it to count. If there's any way to tie it to you, it would count.

Once it’s out of your possession, assume it to be gone forever.  My guess is that your parents want you to feel dependent on them, and that is why they want to steal your money from you. In fact you could move out today. You have a job. You have £9,000 in savings. That’s significantly more than most adults in the uk. You’re far better off than I am, for example and I live comfortably.  Another option is to go to your council’s housing office and tell them that you are “homeless today” (use those exact words on whichever day you go) due to fleeing domestic abuse. They will put you in temporary accommodation - it may not be the nicest place to live but you will be safe. Your social worker will help you with this, it may be worth contacting them yourself rather than waiting for your form tutor to do it. Once you are out, don’t let your family know your new address. If you meet them do so in public.  Look into getting universal credit, that should help to top up your income and help with rent. You’ve got so much in savings that you won’t get the full rate of the housing allowance but you may get some - the DWP are the people to talk to about universal credit. The upper limit in savings for benefits is £16,000 so as long as you’re below that you’ll get something. Make sure to be honest about your savings and earnings and feel no shame about claiming.

1564,1947,"Hi,  The short answer is probably not. The reason is because the CPR doesn't impose a duty on district judges to assist unrepresented defendants. Only Legal Advisers in the CPR have that duty.  Could the legal adviser at the first hearing (assuming there wasn't a judge there) have been expected to tell you that your position would be improved by having a expert witness give evidence? I wouldn't have thought so. The duty isn't construed so be so broad. It's principally construed as a duty to assist you in communicating with the court.  Could the judge at your trial have been expected to ask the question which they remarked in their decision might have helped? No. And what's more, just because the judge expressed a view that the answer to the question might have helped, your question presupposes that the judge thought such a question would be helpful *at the time* the witness was giving evidence, and *chose* not to ask it on your behalf. It could just has easily have been the case that the judge retired to consider his decision, and only at that stage thought that such a question would have assisted you.  I'm going to assume that your trial was for the offence of driving with excess alcohol / drugs. The good news is that you have the automatic right of appeal to the Crown Court.

Let them know the previous history of violence and that he wants your money. Police will be able to facilitate the removal of your possessions without a breach of the peace if you don’t want to pursue charges against your dad.  9k is a lot of money and is your security (and seriously well done for saving that much by 17). Life will be a lot easier if you keep it in your possession rather than trying to take your dad through the courts later down the line for money he will likely have spent on nothing in particular. Also, just in terms of your own sanity, if you are fleeing an abusive family it is best to do everything you can now to minimise contact as much as possible once you’re out.  If you were to transfer it out in one go, the bank would likely flag up the transaction and ring or text you to confirm it isn’t fraudulent. They might not, depends on the bank. That will only give you a few extra hours of stalling at most.  I’m really sorry you’re going through this OP. Sometimes our plans are forced to change by the actions of others.

1612,1999,"&gt; if Nana updates her Will, how does this work once they have both passed away? Does one Will override the other? If Nana dies first does it become invalid and Grandad’s Will becomes the leading document if that makes sense?  Wills are stand-alone documents, they don't ""override"" each other.  When your Nana her will will be executed at that point in time. Once her property is passed on then the terms of her will don't generally control what happens to that property afterwards.  So if your Nana dies and leaves everything to your Grandad then when he dies everything is distributed according to his will.  However if your Nana is looking to re-write her will then nothing says she *has* to continue to give everything to your Grandad; she can re-write it so her property goes wherever she wants.  &gt; In a nutshell, I’m asking what can my Mum do and not do in this situation?  There are 2 main lines of attack against a will.  Option one is to attack the validity of the will overall. This can involve showing that there were procedural flaws in its creation (e.g. it wasn't correctly signed and witnessed) or that the testator (person making the will) lacked testamentary capacity (didn't know what they were doing).  If the will is made professionally it should be fairly proof against procedural defects. A lawyer should also consider the capacity of their client and if there are any doubts it's good practise to note evidence at the time the will is created which can be used later in the event of a challenge.  If a will is successfully invalidated then the fallback would be to any previous valid will or failing that the rules of intestacy.  Option 2 is a claim under the Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975. This can be used by someone who feels a will doesn't make ""reasonable provision"" for them to seek to obtain or increase a legacy. If your Nana leaves 30% of her estate to your mum it's unlikely she would have much scope to succeed in such a claim.",1615878455,LegalAdviceUK,gr3l0fp

Nan then dies, everything passes in accordance with her (hopefully updated since 1996) Will. The reason a solicitor may not be able to give you an answer on the phone thus far is because there used to be (it's bad practice now) something called joint Wills (different from mirror Wills) which may be relevant but I won't go into that now. Suffice to say, your grandparents, or your Nan at least, should see a solicitor to make a  ew Will and take a copy of their existing Wills.   I should mention that dementia does not necessarily mean that you do not have testamentary capacity...it depends how severe G'dad's capacity has been affected.  2. Your mum could attack the validity of the Will, e.g. say Nan didn't understand it, it was coerced into including your father so that's all the more reason to instruct a professional to draw up the Will.

1627,2024," It looks like your post is about changing your name. Some basic information that may answer your question is below:  * You do not need to enter into any legal process to go by a different name; you can simply start using the new name. There is no such thing as having a ""legal name"" in the UK. (This is if you are an adult - for children, the process is more complex, depending on the circumstances.)  * In law, your name can be anything you like, so long as it is not chosen to deceive and commit fraud. However, government agencies such as the Passport Office and DVLA have restrictions on what they will register as a name (e.g. they will typically not accept names that are vulgar, blasphemous or offensive), so you should be careful to ensure your proposed new name will comply with these before changing it, or you may not be able to change your identity documents.  * To evidence your change of name (e.g. to banks or other businesses, or to obtain ID in your new name) and to create a documentary link between the old and new name, you will need to have a deed poll. You can in most circumstances print your own deed poll, sign it and have it witnessed at home for free; further information and a generator for these can be found at http://www.freedeedpoll.org.uk, the UK government also provides guidance [here](https://www.gov.uk/change-name-deed-poll/make-an-adult-deed-poll).  * A correctly signed and witnessed deed poll should be sufficient to evidence your change of name to the satisfaction of most commercial and government entities. It is advisable to obtain new ID in your new name.  * Contrary to popular belief and what some organisations may tell you, you do not *need* to have the deed poll enrolled for it to be valid once signed and witnessed, although since it provides an incontrovertible proof of the change of your name, which may be useful, you can do so if you wish to for a nominal fee. Some organisations may also insist on a deed poll being enrolled before they'll accept it. See [here](https://www.gov.uk/change-name-deed-poll/enrol-a-deed-poll-with-the-courts) for more information on the process to follow.  * **In Scotland** - see [here](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/registration/recording-change-of-forename-and-surname-in-scotland)  * **In Northern Ireland** - see [here](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/recording-change-name)  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

There's two things I know about regulators in the UK from my professional experience:   1. They almost universally undertake risk-based regulation led by intelligence gathered through a reporting scheme; and  2. Except in the most serious cases, they work with providers to fix issues rather than taking enforcement action, if they even decide to take action at all (the regulatory risk may not be sufficiently serious).    Those two things in mind, domestic CCTV is very low risk of affecting the rights and freedoms of individuals, therefore it is of very low regulatory interest. And in the event that a complaint was raised and a case officer in a bad mood picked up the report, the most likely outcome is still no action or at worst an advisory letter.

The first is just claiming an interest in the property (a resulting or constructive trust); the second is a claim that he was promised the land and acted on that promise (the proprietary estoppel mentioned by pflurklurk) or he believes he should have received a share of the estate (1975 Act claim).

1681,2093,"You need independent legal advice.  If the house is in his name and you were to divorce, I’d have thought it would become a marital asset like any other. It would be much harder if the house was owned by the trust at all times.  Once married you could register your matrimonial home rights with the Land Registry. The house then cannot easily be sold without your agreement. Doing this is as easy as completing a short form.  In the event of your marriage breaking down, you would then be able to prevent its sale pending division of assets as part of the divorce process.  The fact that you and your partner would be living rent free would allow you to buy a second home together, which you could let out. This would then be a home/asset that you own together and equivalent to the marital home owned by other couples. This might not be to the liking of your in-laws but they don’t need to know and your partner is going to have to acknowledge your concerns at some stage.  I suspect that neither you nor your partner really have any influence over the precise terms of this agreement. You either have to say “yes” or “no” to what’s offered. There are probably ways of saying “yes” that leave you both better off and without risking your future security.  In any event, before agreeing to anything, you should sit down and talk things through with a divorce solicitor. This might feel wrong/disloyal but you need to understand your position.

You can can up the police to day that you are now a reluctant witness and are no longer willing to attend court.  Once you've given a statement, a court can insist on you attending and can issue a warrant for you to attend if you fail to do so. However, that said, the entire circumstances are generally weighed up, and if it's a minor matter with little ongoing risk the likelihood is that it wouldn't be taken that far, and the police would simply drop the matter. However, if there is an ongoing risk (an easy example is if you saw Jane attacking her partner with a knife, the partner refused to engage and they are still together) then the police and courts could decide it is very much in the public interest to proceed. The case would be looked at on its own merits.",1615849913,LegalAdviceUK,gr2d0te
1689,2101,"If you mean it went to criminal court, then yes, technically it is of course a crime to accuse someone of a crime that they absolutely didn't commit - perverting the course of justice.  However, there are a few things which need to be noted.  Firstly, the police would have investigated the entire situation - so not just taken the allegation as true and charged your friend, but taken his account and investigated it. If it had been found that his wife has made an absolute, demonstrably false claim then he wouldn't have been charged and it would have been her dealt with for wasting police time or even perverting the course of justice.  The fact he was charged demonstrates it wasn't this clear cut, and that CPS felt at the time of charging that there was at least a 51% chance of conviction.  At court, he may have produced a defence (I did do those things, but have a lawful reason as to why): for example yes I slapped her but only because she was attacking me with a knife, it was reasonable self defence. If he succeeded with a defence, then the allegation from the side wouldn't be seen as a false report, it's simply that the court have examined the full facts and decided his actions were justified. In this scenario then she didn't commit an offence by reporting the assault on her.  If his defence at court was ""This absolutely didn't happen and she's made the whole thing up"" then I can understand why you may think that a not guilty finding would suggest that she is a liar and should be dealt with, but that's not the case. In court, to be convicted you must be found guilty beyond reasonable doubt on the evidence presented. If the court think ""he probably did do it, but I'm not sure"" then the correct verdict is not guilty. Due to this, a not guilty plea will not automatically lead to evidence of an attempt to pervert the course of justice by the complainant. Which is good really, as otherwise who on earth would risk reporting anything.  So in all likelihood the scenario is that the police have already investigated the matter anyway, didn't find anything at the time of significance to suggest she was lying, and so a subsequent allegation is unlikely to go anywhere, unless new evidence could be produced to show that she had told a deliberate lie. So simply a complaint from you, presumably not adding anything new other than ""Hey look, he was not guilty"" is never, ever going to meet that bar.",1615849632,LegalAdviceUK,gr2cl9c

This is for stuff like leaks, broken front door locks, etc. If you get there and there's no front door, for example, I think you'd still be expected to inform the landlord and give them a chance to fix it. Obviously they'd have to fix it promptly, because you can't live in a house with no front door.  It's an emergency, but it's not an ""if I don't fix this immediately, it'll cause more damage"" emergency.

In the UK, you can call yourself anything you like, so long as you do not do so with the intention to defraud.   So there is no legal ""standard"" for your ""real"" name, so long as it's consistent up to the standard assumptions.  There are practical reasons why it is helpful to have documents in the same name, but I would suggest that if you have a passport in the name of ""Albert Bjorn Colombo Danielson"" and a proof of address letter in the name of ""Albert Danielson"" no-one, ever, is going to question it, while if your passport is in that name and you have a letter in the name of ""Albert Colombo"" or ""Albert Bjorn Colombo"" it's less likely to work.  I would go further and say that if your objective is ""a smooth negotiation of standard address verification checks with a native speaker in the UK"", then if you passport is in the name ""Albert Any Number Of Words It Really Does Not Matter"" then a letter to ""Albert Matter"" will be accepted.  There's a reason why colloquially they're called ""First Name"" and ""Last Name"", and realistically they're all that matters.  There are all sorts of myths about names in the UK, which often get bound up with nonsense about how married women are ""really"" Mrs Husbandname even if they aren't.

For instance, a private profile to friends and family where you showed a picture of self-harm or going to a sexual health clinic - that would likely give rise to an expectation of privacy, and it would be actionable against the person misusing the information (and perhaps render dismissal unfair).

The way he approaches the issue will help you see if your fears are more likely to be realised, or not.  3 - Please understand that it takes more than love for a marriage to flourish. I say this because you will have no respect in this home, should you proceed on the terms you've described. Not only do you own nothing but in essence, neither does he. So you will answer to your husband, your husband's mum and dad, and his siblings. You live in their house so be prepared to play host and be at their beck and call for as long as that is so.  4 - A simple mobile phone contract can earn you up to 800 pts on your credit score (on the Experian scale).

But don't rush into it because of a false sense of security.  Solutions  I'd say any solution you come up with on your own isn't a solution.   If you're to be married soon then you should be discussing this together and you should both own your property, together. Bluntly, they are already aligned for a divorce without you even marrying their son. This is a huge bright red flag - RUN.  However, you're fiance is probably the sweetest guy and his family are just trying to protect their own so here's an idea:  You both don't live in the house his parents are buying. Let it out and use the money to pay for a rented flat, then you both save up and buy your place together.

1819,2241,"&gt;jamjar202  This is not quite right. The law is complicated and this is by no means a complete explanation but:  Intellectual property rights are territorial. The Berne Convention means that each member (in this case the US and the UK) must treat the copyright of works of authors from other members of the convention at least as well as those of its own nationals. in this case, OP will have the same IP protection in the US as though he/she were a US national. OP will have copyright in the character in the UK if the criteria are fulfilled.  In the UK:  For literary and dramatic works (LDM works), the work must be recorded - hopefully OP's character and all their attributes were recorded. There is no requirement for artistic works to be recorded (but it may be hard to prove creation without it being recorded!).  Trade marks can be registered or unregistered. Registered trade marks give rights set out in the Trade Marks Act 1994, notably to sue for trade mark infringement for identical/similar marks that are for identical/similar goods/services. People often refer to 'trademarking' or similar when they mean registering a trade mark.  It is not illegal (a criminal offence) to make a complete and total copy of a work created and owned by another owner. It is acts in relation to an infringing copy that are illegal (e.g. making infringing copies available for sale or hire). It is unlawful (a civil wrong meaning you can sue) to reproduce or communicate to the public a copyright work without consent of the owner (unless a defence/exception applies).  For copyright infringement, it does not matter if the alleged infringing work is 'substantially different'. The test is whether the copyright work has been copied as a whole or any substantial part of it. EU law (retained) has imposed a different test where the substantial part means 'contains an expression of the author's intellectual creation'. The CJEU have said that 11 words could satisfy this requirement (see Infopaq case).  You have used the UK test for originality, where EU law has imposed a different test - copyright subsists in any work if it is an 'expression of the author's intellectual creation'. The courts have not fully harmonised the UK and EU's approach.  If OP seriously wants to consider this, he/she needs to speak to an IP litigation solicitor.",1615840030,LegalAdviceUK,gr1wavz

But if your name cannot be represented by standard software in the country in which you live, you have two choices.  You can tilt at windmills and fight a lifelong battle to have every piece of software (and associated cards and other documents) modified to not only store, but print and provide means of input for, your name.  Or you can adopt a single localised name that fits on local forms. Usually a Roman transliteration of the parts most commonly used, which most countries can cope with.  Fighting this has right on your side.  But you should prepare for a long and futile battle with officialdom in which even if you manage to win the occasional tactical skirmish you will be ground down by the strategic war.  I am reminded of sitting in a meeting in the late 1980s, being told by an American that X.400 O/R names (or it might have been X.500, I forget) covered all cases as they consisted of a given name, an initial, a surname and a generational qualifier.

I will edit the post to add additional information, but to clarify:  We are not the buyers, nor have any kind of relationship with the buyer - our interest is only because the planning permission conditions were put in place for the benefit of developing our plot.  I don't know precisely why the deed #2 strip was missed, but part of the reason may be because it existed prior to manditory Land Registry registration. Deed #1 was registered, deed #2 is unregistered, and the deed #2 strip is so narrow that it is likely imperceptible on maps. Its positioning could well allow it to be used as a ransom strip.  As to the parties that were unaware of the two separate deeds: it is my understanding that the buyer was not aware of the strip. Further, the council were supplied a drawing as part of the application, in which the strip's location appears to fall within the red line boundary (no mention is made of the strip itself, or of there being any land between the boundaries). The planning application was made on behalf of the owners of deed #1 and deed #2, who did not make the council aware the land consisted of two deeds.

1947,2429,"Kind of possible in theory, but in practice incredibly unlikely. I don't think there has been many cases at all in which UK-based offices/branches/employees have successfully argued against the budgeting of worldwide companies - it's just too difficult to do so as there's usually a reasonable defence on the part of the employer to rebuff such a claim. Namely, that the cost of doing business across the globe fluctuates - so generally employees based in say Scandinavia, Switzerland or the US (obviously a terrible example for a union-based question) will always be paid higher wages for a comparable role due to cost of living in the area. I would say that sector-wide unionisation and collective bargaining falls under that reasonability defence.   If there was some element of grounds for it, I struggle to see how employees would even bring it to a tribunal. They'd have to already be unionised, or start to unionise, in which case they'd have more luck just saying 'tools down until we get our salary increase' than try to bring a large scale claim for discrimination against an employer's international decisions. They could *maybe* argue that their international employer has discriminated against all based in the UK on the basis of nationality - but really at the end of the day they're not really zeroing in or indirectly affecting a protected characteristic.

If it helps, my wife was in a no fault accident about two years ago. Her prices are back to normal now, there was only one year where they went up about £50.

I would suggest a complaint against the emergency service to be the best solution. There's no way one of the other emergency services is going to support one of their drivers pulling people over, and it would be dealt with.  I'd call 101 back and tell them you want to make a complaint against the relevant emergency service and ask them for the details of which service to complain to.  If they still refuse to give the details at that point, ask to make a complaint against the police regarding the handling of your case instead, and that would then eventually lead to the right place.",1615825273,LegalAdviceUK,gr0ywzz

Once IHT has been worked out and probate granted, you can then sell the property and you then have a potential capital gain on the difference between the probate value of the house and the actual sale price less expenses.

An unmarked police vehicle can stop a car, but only if there is an officer in uniform in the vehicle (and no, they don't have to be wearing a hat). If you didn't stop your vehicle and they are not in uniform then by law you don't commit an offence by not stopping. The fact however that you did stop your vehicle when they aren't in uniform doesn't necessarily make the stop illegal, it just means you technically complied when not legally obliged to do so. The grey area is whether or not they are impersonating a police officer.

Yeah for the council tax we got a letter through like normal and set up our account with them. But for water and electric we didn't seem to get anything aside from letters to the estate agents. I ended up calling the water company last week as I was getting uneasy over not hearing anything from them and that seems to be all sorted.

Unless your DM has registered a trademark himself or already sells books about your character, I don't see how they would stop you - although likewise I don't see how you'd stop them if they tried it.   Note this would only cover the name of the character, nothing about the story itself.  If you are planning on building a universe around this character, then you might want to trademark their name anyway. At least in the UK you can do this online and might not even need an attorney - it costs £170. I'm not sure about the US.

If the police officer observed the battery being insecure and considered it dangerous - yes - that's a perfectly valid stop and fine.  If he read it off a failure to renew slip and said that it's dangerous - that's a whole different matter. OP has not yet provided clarity as to whether the police officer observed the battery.

Then it’s a case of phoning them and setting up your account.   I assume either the previous tenant has not closed the account (or never paid their bills) or the letting agent has assumed responsibility when the property has been unoccupied. Thus, no one has closed the previous account, and the energy supplier still assuming someone else is responsible for the bills.

2116,2628,"Tell your insurance that you were in an accident, tell them what happened without embellishment or redaction, and tell them that police at the scene have told you that they don't believe you to have been at fault.     If you are getting pain in your neck or any referred symptoms into the rest of your body (face, arms, torso etc), you absolutely must go to hospital. For two reasons:     1. Medical evidence is best collected early and with waiting times long due to covid, any ongoing documentary evidence of symptoms will take longer to collect than usual. 2. You may have an injury that will affect you for the rest of your life and this needs to be treated to minimise any potential disability later on down the line.  If there is a significant chance of long term disablement from the injury then your payout will reflect that but you need to get checked out now. Your insurers may also ask for a private gp to examine you if this were to go to court, but that would be months away.     Your insurance will increase slightly in the event of a no fault claim, nowhere near as much as if you were at fault (even then it's not that significant).

2303,2856," It looks like your post is about changing your name. Some basic information that may answer your question is below:  * You do not need to enter into any legal process to go by a different name; you can simply start using the new name. There is no such thing as having a ""legal name"" in the UK. (This is if you are an adult - for children, the process is more complex, depending on the circumstances.)  * In law, your name can be anything you like, so long as it is not chosen to deceive and commit fraud. However, government agencies such as the Passport Office and DVLA have restrictions on what they will register as a name (e.g. they will typically not accept names that are vulgar, blasphemous or offensive), so you should be careful to ensure your proposed new name will comply with these before changing it, or you may not be able to change your identity documents.  * To evidence your change of name (e.g. to banks or other businesses, or to obtain ID in your new name) and to create a documentary link between the old and new name, you will need to have a deed poll. You can in most circumstances print your own deed poll, sign it and have it witnessed at home for free; further information and a generator for these can be found at http://www.freedeedpoll.org.uk, the UK government also provides guidance [here](https://www.gov.uk/change-name-deed-poll/make-an-adult-deed-poll).  * A correctly signed and witnessed deed poll should be sufficient to evidence your change of name to the satisfaction of most commercial and government entities.

Looking at it objectively, this person seems to be full of air, with no substance, and you're giving them WAY too much thought, credit and time. This is the sort of person I'd have a laugh, and promptly walk away from, never to look back.  I completely understand, though, that this work is very important to you and so any threat towards it should definitely be taken seriously and I hope the legal answers on here have given you some peace of mind.  As for this person, cut off all contact, including sharing/ receiving information through mutual friends.

Also from what you’ve said this isn’t a judgement of what she’s wearing, but whether or not she is working for another company.    Taking a screenshot of a public post on Instagram is not ‘using’ it as you suggest.    Over the past year plenty of people have lost their jobs for posts on social media that have been screenshotted and shown to the employers through news websites etc.    The legal question is whether or not your wife has received payment for doing another job and whether that is a firing offence.

2309,2863,"Sure, I didn’t elaborate because I don’t think it’s actually helpful to you.  The picture constitutes personal data so the GDPR applies to the employer’s use of it.  As part of those obligations the employer needs to comply with the obligation to provide the privacy information listed in article 14 (usually done in a privacy notice, but may be in other ways).  If the employer has not provided that information then use of the picture is arguably unlawful.  Also, the employer needs a “legal basis” under article 6 of the GDPR for processing the data, and given the circumstances the only one that could be applicable is “legitimate interests”.  To rely on this the employer needs to identify a “legitimate interest” to use the data, and then weigh that interest against any adverse impact on the data subject (your wife).  This analysis is highly contextual, but the fact that they are “private” pictures (by that I mean outside the context of work) and she is in a bikini would be factors against reliance on legitimate interests.  The legitimate interest relied on also needs to be described in the privacy notice.  It’s difficult to say without knowing the full picture, but the employers use of the data could arguably violate the GDPR.  The reason I say I don’t think this is helpful is because the fact is they already have the picture, and an arguable breach of data protection law isn’t going to impact the position from an employment law perspective.  From a data protection law perspective, one option would be to object to the processing of the image and/or request that they delete it on the basis that it is processed unlawfully.  I don’t think the employer would uphold that request, but it would put it down on record in a formal context from a data protection perspective",1615804765,LegalAdviceUK,gqzzoc9

Her colleague couldn't take the photo and use it as an advert for that bikini, but they can take it and share it with friends/colleagues. Its no different to them sharing a link to the photo (which i believe you can do on Instagram)- the only difference is your wife not getting the views herself.

2410,2980,"Are you and your partner in England/Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland?  How long has your partner been continuously employed by the airline?  What job does she have?  Assuming your partner has been employed for more than 2 years, the employer has to follow a fair procedure in attempting to dismiss her. That generally means carrying out a fair investigation and will usually mean she would receive warnings before being dismissed.  If it can be said dismissing your partner would fall within the range of reasonable responses any other employer would take (ie would any other airline dismiss in these circumstances? If yes, then the dismissal would be fair). The employer would still need to follow a fair procedure. From what you’ve described, it doesn’t sound like dismissal in these circumstances would be reasonable.  If your partner has not been employed for 2 years then dismissal is much easier for the employer. However, many big companies nowadays will follow a fair procedure for everyone. It would be worth reading the employer’s disciplinary policies.  The Acas website has some useful info which I would recommend you visiting. If your partner does get dismissed it is likely that she would be at least entitled to work her contractual notice period (or be paid it in lieu).  To bring an unfair dismissal claim your partner must contact Acas and bring a claim in the employment tribunal within 3 months of dismissal so don’t wait around if this happens.",1615787820,LegalAdviceUK,gqzioti

2414,2985,"Short answer: Your former GM has no chance in hell.  Long answer:  Because the US and the UK are both members of the Berne Convention (an international convention on protecting the rights of authors and artists) then only the copyright law of the country of distribution applies which in this case would be the UK (which is handy since I'm only trained in UK law not US).  There are many different types of IP ownership but unless your former GM has taken out a trademark (which would NEVER be granted unless something actually substantive had been created such as a book or module that was for sale) then the only one that would apply here is copyright.  Before I go on I want to make one message crystal clear; the following paragraph is me indulging in theory and has nothing to do with your case. Since the character was created and played by you, it is yours and therefore.none of this next paragraph applies to it. If you only want the applicable answer, skip the next paragraph.   Copyright is, at least in the UK, exactly as it sounds; it is the right to make an exact copy of a complete, substantial and commerical work. Making a completely and total copy of a work created and ownes by another is illegal. But in the UK it is not difficult at all for something to be declared substantially different. To quote the minimum standard for a unique work in the UK: there must be some ""skill, labour, and judgment"" that has gone into it. The only way copyright could, maybe, possibly, probably not but conceivably, be engaged is if you lifted the entirety campaign beat for beat and sold it as your own. Even then I'd doubt a court would rule against you unless the original campaign had been trademarked or was being published as well, but as I said I'm just theorising here.  The substantive conclusion is this: Nobody but the player has ownership over their characters unless the player agrees to give (or sell) those rights to another at some point alongside express permission to use them in a work to be sold, or if the player is playing an already trademarked character (i.e. if you had made your PC literally Mickey Mouse, identical in looks, personality and name, you might struggle getting a book about him published). You are the inventor of the character, they are yours to do with as you will. Full stop.   You would not need to have made any substantive changes to the character as it is already yours. However since you have made changes, even if it was for some unlikely reason disputed who the creator was of the character as it originally was concieved it would still not matter because that is a substantially different character from the one you have now. You are ironclad, airtight and utterly legally in the clear.",1615782298,LegalAdviceUK,gqzbuyo

Crossed meters - in flats, meters can become mixed up, the Meter Serial Number (MSN) for your flat may be wrong and they are reading the wrong meter or, I think the more likely, your meter is for the whole building not just your flat. You would put on a high energy usage appliance and check which meter is recording the usage to check this, if the meters are all in a separate room. If the meter is in the flat, no appliances are being used, and yet energy is then it may be the electricty meter is for the whole building not just your flat. You would not be liable for the bills if the meters were crossed as you had not been billed correctly by SSE and they should be able to bill you correctly on the correct meter. If the meter is for the whole building you would be expected to dispute that with your landlord not SSE. 2. Time on E10 clock is wrong - if the clock is wrong your E10 usage was being recorded at the wrong time and any usage may be getting recorded on the higher Peak rate (Day rate usually). You would take 3 meter readings during the day - early morning, E10 time in the afternoon and evening to see which register is recording usage. The bills could be corrected taking in to account the error with the clock. 3. Immersion heater left on - E10 and Economy 7 buildings usually use an immersion heater for the water and these can be on a separate circuit to the E10 heating and can be left on. In this case you would be liable for the bills.  Raise a complaint with SSE to say you are disputing the bills, then contact your landlord to see if you can check the meters.

If a company decides to remove their app, to configure their software, because they want you to buy newer hardware. Where are your digital rights? Can you be protected in the same way as the upcoming 'right to repair' laws?   A software company can remove or add feature as they want and leave you high and dry in a mess. They can put up their prices  and give you no protection. You can't switch companies, if all your data are tied into that product.     If they go bankrupt, you have no protection what so ever, compared if you had bought a piece of software you owned outright on a CD.     They have enticed you to buy a product, now they are blocking certain features. It is definably unfair.",1615769172,LegalAdviceUK,gqyqfp7

If it's a valid LPA and validly used to sever, then you need to go to the Court of Protection to have the severance validated or rejected (and the conduct of the other attorneys examined).

If your father has an active LPA for healthcare or financial decisions which has been used already then it would be very difficult for your sisters to argue that he is of sound mind to change his will.  I'm not sure if your sisters can serve notice on your Dad's behalf regarding the house ownership. If it does require the LPA, Joint LPAs usually require all the people on the LPA to agree together, it's not a document that allows any of you to act alone, which is why the recommendations are usually to have one, or a maximum of two people named on an LPA for ease of coming to agreements and lawfully using the authority it gives. The LPA can also only be used to act in your Dad's best interests. It will be very hard for your sisters to argue that effectively altering his will in their own favour is acting in his best interests, and if all three signatures are needed then clearly you won't be providing yours.  Could set up a camera to video then have a conversation with your Dad about the whole thing? Is he aware of it? Does he want your sisters to get his share of the house? Does he remember the previous conversations and why the previous decision was made? The outcome of that conversation should tell you a lot and if as you suspect he doesn't really know what's happening then the video would be powerful evidence.

I believe all McDonald's are required to allow employees to have a ""HIG"" chat with a manager if things aren't right. HIG stands for ""How's it going?"" The point of these is to nip things in the bud before problems grow. I recommend you write down the dates of whenever you've had to stay over more than, say, 5 minutes and whenever your clocks have been changed. Also screenshot your clock records on MySchedule. Then you could ask your Business Manager for a HIG chat. Let them know that it's hard on you to have to stay over a lot, especially due to your schoolwork and that you find the manual editing of your clocks to cut into the hard work you do. For those who don't know, the Business Manager is the head manager of an individual McDonald's restaurant and is responsible for it as a whole unit.   Don't be scared to politely, but firmly say to your manager that you were meant to finish x minutes ago. It's easy to lose track of things as a manager so they may have honestly forget, or are waiting for crew to come off break or get on shift to replace you. It may also advantage you to give a gentle reminder to the manager running the floor of when you finish 15 to 30 minutes before you do.

So if I say ""I'm going to hit you tomorrow"", and you believe me, that's not an assault, because the violence isn't feared *immediately*.  Whereas if I say ""I'm going to hit you"" and raise my fist, and you believe me, that's an assault, because the violence is feared immediately.  And if I actually hit you, that's battery.  Catcalls or whistling are unlikely to fall into that definition: the victim is unlikely to be made to fear that they will *immediately* be subjected to force.  The classic example of a non-physical assault is [*R v Ireland* \[1997\] 3 WLR 534](http://www.e-lawresources.co.uk/R-v-Ireland.php), where Ireland was convicted of assault by virtue of making silent phone calls, which caused the victims to fear that they would (while on the phone or immediately afterwards) be subjected to violence.  As the Court said:  &gt;It is to assault in the form of an act causing the victim to fear an immediate application of force to her that I must turn [...] The proposition that a gesture may amount to an assault, but that words can never suffice, is unrealistic and indefensible. A thing said is also a thing done. There is no reason why something said should be incapable of causing an apprehension of immediate personal violence, e.g. a man accosting a woman in a dark alley saying ""come with me or I will stab you.""

It could also very well be other inconsiderate dwellers putting crap down their toilet that blocks the main drain.  The issue you face is what is in your tenancy agreement:  &gt; 8.2.12 To clear or pay for the clearance of any blockage or over-flow when any occur in any of the drains, gutters, down-pipes, sinks, toilets or waste pipes which serve the Property, if the blockage is caused by the negligence of, or the misuse by the Tenant, his family or any visitors.   So you should ask for proof that the last issue was caused by the negligence of others in the building (i.e. did the drain company actually find wipes &amp; other unsuitable matter during the last visit?). Then if they do have an issue in future you can ask for that proof if/when they do try to charge you.

She ended the relationship, she made that decision and she's being abusive - you don't want to give in to abuse when you're trapped because abusers will simply acknowledge that as precedent to push you as far as they can.   Personally, I'd tell the landlord now that you're giving your notice for the end of the tenancy and inform them that because she has chosen to end your relationship, any and all communication needs to be sent to both of you because you cannot trust her to pass on messages to you or to be honest about the situation. I'd cc your ex into that email (and tell her in person in advance what you're planning on doing if you're on good enough terms). It's not rare for exes to start falsifying or manipulating complaints to landlords to get an ex out or in bad favour - so get your landlord aware in advance.  Who is the main tenant listed on the tenancy deposit? Who pays the rent?   Keep a log of the abuse, preferably a hardcopy in a notepad - every day, take a photo of the log for that day and email it to yourself so you have a copy in case she finds/destroys your log. If she does anything illegal then contact the police - if she makes allegations against you then show them your log.   Try to stay in communal areas as much as you can. Many people in your position would retire into the spare room or the bathroom and hide away to stay away from their ex. This creates a dynamic where you cannot use your home and it doesn't end well for you. Live your life as if you're living alone - aside from keeping your log.

Not a Doctor either, but a diagnosis of ASPD would have quite a high bar to achieve, with sustained evidence of disrespect for the law/normal ethical standards. Its unclear how you meet this high bar, having presumably avoided past criminal convictions (correct me if I’m wrong), and having held a steady job in a respected profession.  Go to a doctor. Describe your symptoms. Leave the diagnosis to them, and worry about the fallout later on. The only circumstances that they would be able to disclose confidential information are set out here: https://www.gmc-uk.org/ethical-guidance/ethical-guidance-for-doctors/confidentiality/disclosing-patients-personal-information-a-framework  The guidance is quite intuitive. If you have a range of mainly self-regarding mental health symptoms, there’s likely little reason for them to disclose the symptoms to an employer. If you say that you have strong urges to hurt children which you are scared you might act on, then they likely will.

Section 12 provides that in certain circumstances, you are empowered to sell the goods in question *and pay her the proceeds, less reasonable sale costs*.   In order to exercise that right, you need to give the appropriate notices. The first notice, to stay on the safe side, is a notice imposing on her a duty to collect the goods, under section 12(2) and paragraph 1 of Schedule 1:  &gt; (1) For the purposes of section 12(1) a bailee may, in the circumstances specified in this Part of this Schedule, by notice given to the bailor impose on him an obligation to take delivery of the goods.  &gt; (2) The notice shall be in writing, and may be given either—  &gt;&gt; (a) by delivering it to the bailor, or  &gt;&gt; (b) by leaving it at his proper address, or  &gt;&gt; (c) by post.  &gt; (3) The notice shall—  &gt;&gt; (a) specify the name and address of the bailee, and give sufficient particulars of the goods and the address or place where they are held, and  &gt;&gt; (b) state that the goods are ready for delivery to the bailor, or where combined with a notice terminating the contract of bailment, will be ready for delivery when the contract is terminated, and  &gt;&gt; (c) specify the amount, if any, which is payable by the bailor to the bailee in respect of the goods and which became due before the giving of the notice.  The second notice is a notice of intention to sell the goods, under section 3(a) and Part II (paragraph 6) of Schedule 1:  &gt; (1) A notice under section 12(3) shall—  &gt;&gt; (a) specify the name and address of the bailee, and give sufficient particulars of the goods and the address or place where they are held, and  &gt;&gt; (b) specify the date on or after which the bailee proposes to sell the goods, and  &gt;&gt; (c) specify the amount, if any, which is payable by the bailor to the bailee in respect of the goods, and which became due before the giving of the notice.  &gt; (2) The period between giving of the notice and the date specified in the notice as that on or after which the bailee proposes to exercise the power of sale shall be such as will afford the bailor a reasonable opportunity of taking delivery of the goods.  &gt; (3) If any amount is payable in respect of the goods by the bailor to the bailee, and become due before giving of the notice, the said period shall be not less than three months.  &gt; (4) The notice shall be in writing and shall be sent by post in a registered letter, or by the recorded delivery service.  In other words, it is a notice that you will sell the goods unless she collects them within a specified period (which must be a reasonable period).   You can combine the two notices *if* you comply with the more demanding delivery requirements in paragraph 6(4) of Schedule 1.   If she fails to collect the goods within the time you have allowed, you are then entitled to sell the goods in accordance with section 12(3). For such a sale, section 12(5) applies:  &gt; A bailee exercising his powers under subsection (3) shall be liable to account to the bailor for the proceeds of sale, less any costs of sale, and—  &gt;&gt; (a) the account shall be taken on the footing that the bailee should have adopted the best method of sale reasonably available in the circumstances, and  &gt;&gt; (b) where subsection (3)(a) applies, any sum payable in respect of the goods by the bailor to the bailee which accrued due before the bailee gave notice of intention to sell the goods shall be deductible from the proceeds of sale.  There are unlikely to be any sums payable *in respect of the goods* by her to you. You would arguably be on shaky territory if you attempted to deduct unrelated sums she owes you.",1615737158,LegalAdviceUK,gqwmyc2

On the decision notice for the permission they will need to set out the reason for refusal and include a statement about how they sought to overcome the issues with the application, this might be called a positive and proactive statement or something similar. I'd usually expect there to have been some contact between an the council and your architect during the application process.

2774,3476,"The vehicle was advertised as a combi van / crew van. Such vehicles are categories as N1 light goods vehicles suitable for business. The car that was advertised was a ""converted"" M1 passenger vehicle. So all they have done is remove the back seats and pain the back windows same colour as the vehicle original colour. But doing so, this does not change the fact that it is still M1, so it is not a crew van / combi van but is considered as a car and not a Van. The first red flag was the dealer sending me a link to insure the vehicle and when I typed the registration number, it showed an error. I said to myself could be because of their website back-end. But obviously at the time I didn't know that information so I proceeded to sign the contract for the finance which the dealer arranged and paid 40% of the vehicles worth to the dealer. Once that was done, they said ""please make sure you it has insurance on day of collection"". Before that I was checking how much insurance quotes are for combi vans / crew vans and I was okay with the pricing. But when it came time to proceeding with the insurance, I was told that it is a Multi Purpose Vehicle and not a Van and from 250 insurers, only 1 could possibly offer a business insurance for £8 000! The reason for this is because many people but such M1 type vehicles and use it illegally as taxi by insuring it as a business.   Overall the vehicle is not a combi van / crew van as listed both on AutoTrader and their website, but is just a 9 seater passenger car. ""Comverting"" a vehicle by removing the last 3 seats at the back and panting windows same colour and calling it a combi van / crew van does not make it a van. I even have a proof of the dealer sending me the email for van insurance!   So now I am in a position where I have paid 40% of the cars worth to the dealer, signed 60% finance for the cars worth, paid fees for insurance consulting to find what the issue is, and paid for 1 year of insurance.

My plan is to call them tomorrow or use the web chat.  Following your advice, I have found example letters from Citizens Advice and Which for rejecting a vehicle based on the Consumer Rights Act 2015. Ideally I will look into Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 also known as ‘Distance Selling Regulations’ based on my research from the suggestions of other kind hearted users like yourself, which I would like to thank them all.   I think my scenario is that I did an online sale, because I signed and email the documents from home and arranged a car collection at the dealership. In fact I was not even let into the dealership and I was outside because of the coronavirus restrictions and I never signed or even got in physical contact with the car, the dealer or any other document.   I will be preparing an official letter dated and signed to send through email to the dealer stating both the distant sales regulation and the fact that the vehicle was advertised as a combi / crew van but in fact according to DVLA records is M1 passenger vehicle and not N1 light goods vehicle.   What is on my mind is, if I should be the one to contact the finance company and explain to them the circumstances of me wanting to cancel the finance and get a confirmation of everything?

There is a principle in the health field that 'the patient knows best' and that will work for her.

In essence, with any purchase you make at a distance you have a 14 day right to cancel the agreement. There doesn’t have to be anything wrong with the item, you just have a right to change your mind. I suggest you put this into writing to them as soon as possible and ensure it’s dated. You don’t have to word it in any particular way and can find templates for these letters on websites like Which and Citizens Advice. Letters should always be sent by recorded delivery, not signed for. Emails/Facebook any other type of contact is okay but a letter is always preferable.   Should the regulations not apply to you (out of time of similar) then you could always look to rely on the Consumer Rights Act which will allow you to reject at item purchased within 30 days as long as it is either: not fit for purpose, not as described, not of satisfactory quality. Often these issues overlap. Again put this rejection into writing to them and you’re entitled to a refund and the contract to be cancelled. Ensure you date the letter so that if the matter  continues after that period of time you’d still be entitled to that remedy as you brought it up during the correct time frame.   Just as a side note, if a business sells you something not as described, you can report this to trading standard.   I would suggest you also consider checking to see if the garage is a member of any trade associations (AA, RAC etc.) as you could raise the issue with them and often they will assist with the negotiations.

3018,3812,"This happened to us on a leasehold property years ago, scaffolding was actually put up by the council who were the freeholders. It was up for nearly 3 months without any work being even started.  Scaffolding blocked the doorways and basically put every property into darkness. Total health &amp; safety and fire hazard. Someone used it to break into a property upstairs, and I happened to wake up and prevent them coming into our place as well, very scary.   Solution was to club together with the other residents and pay a mates company to come and take all the scaffolding down. We advised and then complained and then warned the council numerous times (I recorded all phone calls) but they ignored us. Gave them a deadline to sort it, which they ignored. So we took it all down and left it in the middle of the street. Amazingly someone came to collect it that very afternoon. The work still hasn’t been done on the building, and about 6 years has passed.  This prob doesn’t help you. Just saying that councils are fucking useless.

3021,3815,"I’m not sure you’ve really contradicted anything I’ve said as Op’s question was about the potential for Op being prosecuted criminally rather than anything to do with insurance and civil matters.  As the scooter will have no insurance op will be able to get the insurance to payout for damage to their vehicle but the effect on their insurance will be down to if the insurance can recoup the costs from the scooter rider.  That would be a civil matter rather than a criminal one, so the police/CPS wouldn’t be involved. I doubt the scooter rider would try to start a civil claim against OP unless they have severe injuries, and even if they did the odds of the winning would be small, but that would be dealt with by OP’s insurance.   The police may however decide to prosecute the scooter rider but that would have no real effect on OP’s situation. If (hypothetically speaking) OP wasn’t being honest about their account then it’s possible they would face some kind of prosecution for a driving offence, but given the circumstances OP described I agree it would be highly unlikely. It is best for OP not to confuse matters by inadvertently admitting some kind of liability or making contact with the other party and potentially accidentally incriminating themselves in the process.",1615682843,LegalAdviceUK,gquq2q7

To create a hypothetical situation, imagine the unlikely event the police were in fact watching and got note of her IP, then somehow managed to get her real IP from the VPN or otherwise, managed to subpoena her ISP for the details and get the address to her shared house.   What then? They don't know who in the house it would have been, and if they came kicking the door down there would be no evidence of any wrongdoing.   As another poster said they tend to go after prolific users that will store loads of it and post, have a presence on these sorts of things.

3044,3842,"There is an outside possibility that the defence agree with everything that you said in your statement, in which case your statement can be read out as your evidence in court and you may not need to attend.  But, given you are the victim and he is pleading guilty this is very unlikely.  So, this in all likelihood means you will be required to attend to give evidence as a prosecution witness.  This means that when the point in the trial comes for your evidence, the prosecution will go first.  You will go up in the box and they will ask you a series of questions about what happened.  These will generally not be yes/no questions but more open questions like ""can you take us through what happened?"" ""what did he look like?"".  The defence will then cross examine you.  This line of questioning will be a bit different, and will often be more closed, leading questions to try to get you to contradict or undermine the evidence you gave to the prosecution's questions.  It might be stuff like ""did you hit him first?""  ""he didn't actually hit you did he?""    The prosecution can then ask you some more questions if they need to re-clarify anything.

3049,3847,"&gt;What am I looking at? Considereing i was planning to drive for an hour after. Any Jail time, fine, ban etc.  When sentencing for most common offences, magistrates rely on a document called ""Sentencing Guidelines"".  These are authoritative documents which magistrates must sentence in line with.    Unfortunately there are no sentencing guidelines for the offence of driving while the proportion of a specified drug in your blood exceeds the limit (under section 5A of the Road Traffic Act 1988).  But there is a guidance document anyway, [here](https://www.sentencingcouncil.org.uk/offences/magistrates-court/item/drug-driving-guidance-only/).  In my experience, at your level and assuming you have no previous convictions, I'd expect:  * Prison time - even a suspended sentence - is so unlikely that I am confident enough to call it ""impossible"".  This is not something you should worry about.  * A twelve-month driving ban is **guaranteed** - the court legally has to give you a driving ban of at least twelve months, unless you can show that banning you from driving would cause ""exceptional hardship"", usually to someone else.  Losing your job is not ""exceptional hardship"", that's very much ""ordinary hardship"".  * Given you were 3x the limit, I would expect a longer driving ban, possibly in the region of 18 months to 2 years.  * In terms of punishment, you're probably looking at a large fine or a community order.  &gt;Is it worth paying £500 for a soliciter or should I just go with the duty ones?  Eh... there's no reason not to go with a duty solicitor, they're just as competent.  &gt;I am also a delivery driver right now, so should i look at changing jobs in the next few weeks?  Uh, yes.  &gt;I havent smoked this year and did only twice after the arrest, shall i say I havent smoked since?  Should you lie to the court?  No, that's never a good idea.  As an aside:  please stop buying drugs.  None of this applies if you grow your own, or buy from someone whom you **know** grows their own:  I don't have any moral objections to drugs *per se*.  Quite the contrary in fact - I think that all drugs should be legal.  I think that the social problems drugs cause, they cause because they are prohibited, and legalisation would solve most of those problems.  But the fact is that at the moment, they're not legal.  That means when you buy drugs, you are *by definition* handing your money to a criminal.  The vast majority of cannabis in this country is obtained from two sources:  * It is grown abroad, by people who are held in slave-like conditions or forced to work by criminal gangs under threat of murdering their whole family.  It is smuggled into the UK by people who are being exploited dreadfully.  * It is grown in the UK, by people who are recruited abroad.  They're promised a good life in the UK, and they're smuggled here in terrible conditions after giving their life savings to people smugglers.  Once they arrive, they're put in a cannabis factory and held as slaves, told to work or else their family at home will be killed, given no money, living in squalor.  Whichever of these two options you have, the fight to get your money literally claims lives.  Children stab each other to death on the streets of our towns and cities, over drug-dealing territory.  The entire industry, from top to bottom, is horribly exploitative and damaging, and your money goes to fund it.  You are responsible for the harm you're funding, and tou can't escape moral culpability by saying ""well, if weed was legal, then what I'm doing wouldn't be harmful"".  Weed *isn't* legal, so what you're doing *is* harmful.",1615679753,LegalAdviceUK,gqukq5u

And council blocks tend to be better located, bigger, better storage, and generally built to better standards than newer private builds.

3061,3861,"&gt; My employer stated to me that unless I could prove to them, beyond the official shielding letters, that I was Clinically Extremely Vulnerable, I would have to take the time off as sick leave.

Is that part of your contract or just some sort of informal ""compassionate leave""?  Or did they put you on furlough?   Your employer doesn't have to pay you full pay for time off for shielding.  They also don't have to agree to furlough you.  At best, they are required to pay you statutory sick pay (which is what they seem to want to do).  It sounds like they are treating you like shit but I can't actually see anything where it looks like they are breaking the law or at risk of doing so.  Where they might get into iffy territory is if they refuse to make the reasonable adjustments that are suggested and then fire you for not being able to return to work.

The local authority will probably employ surgeons for maintenance but may outsource/subcontract arborists.

3081,3889,"Answer it honestly but don’t admit liability like others have mentioned. By admitting you’re at fault your NCB will be lost and premiums rise. As for prosecution, the police are taking statements from you and them for a RTC/A report. You said he appeared from your left? So he came up along side you at the give way line? If so then like scooters and motorbikes he should be filtering traffic from the right and not the left. If this was on the road in front of you ie: you were at the give way and rode across your path as you turned left on to the road then he was on the wrong side of the road.  If you crossed lanes turning right and he appeared then he should have slowed down since he would appear in your blind spot.  Like the police would have said, these scooters are illegal, they need to be ridden with a helmet, lights and be fully insured, as for licenses I’m not sure but I think they are classed as learner E-Motorbikes and 125cc bikes. If anything you can press charges for damages to your vehicle. As for the punch, if it didn’t land then the scootie is looking at a section 4 public order offence, if something landed like a slap or a push then they’re looking at common assault.   But rest assured you are not at fault here, that moron shouldn’t have been on the road. Only thing would be to sort out the insurance side, your insurer can give you an estimate for how much it would cost to fix it (but check to see if they will charge for the valuation, also bare in mind they will use their own preferred accident repair garage and they tend to charge higher prices to insurance companies).   Since the scooter didn’t have insurance then you will have to see if either the person riding will pay out for the full cost of repairs (usually out of pocket) or you can check if your insurance covers you for uninsured driver accidents.

I went to thei website and it said ""combi van"". I looked up for a ""Combi Van"" category (which means Crew Van) in their website and the car was showing up. So I liked the ""van"" and contacted dealer. He said he will sort out all the finance for me and that they can even do insurance too but first i need to reverse with £100 the vehicle. After I reserved we went to the document process and he got finance deal for me. I said okay and he said sign the finance document, transfer us 40% of cars worth the rest is sorted with finance. I did that and he said, okay now insure the ""van"" and he sent me a link to insure it. I typed the reg number and it didn not appear. So because I was short on time, i had somebody else do it for me and they explained that it is a Multi Purpose Vehicle and not considered as a crew van (or combi van) and is not good or insurance will be very expensive for such purposes. So the combi van is not a van but MPV, because is converted from 9 seats to 6 and windows painted to look like crew van. Now I don't need a MPV but a van/ crew van and need to sort out refund.

3186,4009,"First off don't admit fault to your insurance company, whilst the Police may see it that you were ""driving without due care and attention"" your insurance company would look at things like the fact the other person should not have even been on the road in the first place and was wearing all dark clothes.  Police could potentially prosecute both parties but insurance would probably write this off as the e-scooter drivers fault, at the very least 50/50. What I would say though is still report this to your insurance company or if they contact you about it be honest. They could white easily cancel your policy if you don't tell them and the other person tries it on, and then you have a load more problems.  As I've said on another comment I used to send questionnaires out. These were not official forms but would help with none serious RTCs. Like I've said if you don't fill it out the officer most likely will just arrange to come and see you, they may even just do it over the phone. All it is for is to help them complete their report and that's it. Usually the officer would have made a good enough questionnaire to cover the whole report.   The good news is that if he has given you a questionnaire most likely he will not be following it up with you (don't take this as exactly what they will do). If this was me I would have written this off as No Further Action with you and I'd tell the e-scooter driver that it was essentially his own fault and he should take this as a lesson learnt.

3224,4054," I took the time and trouble of giving you a detailed reply. They are not ripping you off. As a neutral person, I can tell you they have been fair to you.  I remembered when, on occasions,  I made some wrong judgements about people and I assumed they were trying to cheat me, but in fact I was wrong.     The landlord will not be a penny better off. The letting agency will earn a new commission (however they are providing a service for their labour).   All UK goods and services are subject to VAT (most things include VAT). There is no VAT on certain things such as food. Some businesses will still quote £xxx + VAT.  Many shops include the cost of VAT. In the US, it is known as a sales tax.   They seem to be happy to let you break the contract, but they don't want to be worse off by doing.    \&gt;  Isn’t showing people round properties literally their job? How is that a cost that I’m liable to cover?   An agent earns their commission by finding a tenant. Whether they show it to one person or to a hundred people. If no one takes up the property, they don't get earn a penny. That is their pricing structure. No sale - no fee.  In my opinion, that model is better, then telling you to pay an upfront marketing fee and they still keep their fee even, if they dont find a successful person. At least, with this pricing structure you have only been asked for pay on success.   The country has been in lockdown since January. People have to stay at home.  Office workers can work safely from home . However, certain class of workers have public facing roles and have to work as they are ""critical"" workers e.g. supermarket worker, doctors, nurses, chemists, delivery staff, bus drivers, postmen, petrol station, mechanics .....  and even letting agents!    All these people are putting themselves at risk for the benefit of keeping the country running. A supermarket worker is n't getting paid ""danger"" money for working in an environment where they can get COVID.  People are worried about passing covid to their family members.  You want the letting agents to go out to do viewings for £0.00 and put themselves and their family at risk?.    \&gt;  Like I said, I wasn’t informed that they lowered the advertised price nor was I informed at any point that I have to pay the difference, so if this has been done without my knowledge, how am I responsible for paying under ‘breach of contract’?      Seriously?   To be blunt,  by making such an argument. The letting agents are probably fed up of you. They probably don't won't want to help you anymore (that is me reading between the lines). They have tried to do you a favour and you have made them feel like they are cheating you.    Imagine a situation, where the rent is £950. The next month you decide you only want to pay £900. That is what you are asking of them to do by breaking the contract. It is going to cost them £300.  So how are they ""milking"" you? On the contrary the landlord and letting agent will be worse off, if they break the contract and accept a reduced rent.    I am sure the letting agents would have tried to get the best offer (they are on commission). However, if they found another student at £900 who is willing to take it today, then this is better to take this deal, rather then to wait  for an offer of £950, which may never come until next academic year.   I am guessing this is a student house and it is mid-term. How many students are looking for accommodation at this time?    They can't put a 60 year old bus driver in a student house. They need to find the right person.     \&gt;  I didn’t ‘choose not to use it’, I have quite literally been unable to, as have many other students from abroad.       Explain.   I have a friends from Spain who are studying in Brighton and Manchester. Their want to enjoy university life and be with their friends.   They were aware of the expected difficulties of lockdown.  Equally, I have read about students trying to get out of their contracts to save on housing cost.      \&gt;  The property is still marked as Let Agreed       No one can tell what has happened. May be the person who saw the property changed his mind. May be he saw a better house with another agent. May be that person has n't passed the referencing.  If this agency, had 3 other desperate students trying to get out of their contract, may be they decide to help them first, rather then help you.   In my viewpoint, (and reading between the lines). The agency feels you have wronged them. It is okay to ask for a breakdown for fees, but to accuse them of milking you, ripping you off..... you are wrong there.",1615667246,LegalAdviceUK,gqtygpi

3267,4099,"Strictly speaking, yes, it is against the law, but you're not going to be prosecuted for it.  The offence committed is ""sexual activity with a child"", under section 9 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003.  This offence is committed in this case because a person aged 18 or over, touched a person aged under 16, and the touching was sexual, and the adult did not reasonably believe that the child is over 16.  Kissing is likely to be sexual touching - I think if it had been a platonic kiss on the cheek, you wouldn't be so worried about it.  If you believed she was 16 or over, then you've committed no crime.  **However**, the Crown Prosecution Service (the government agency which prosecutes crimes) has guidance which says that where the offence is committed between young people of similar ages, and no coercion or exploitation is involved, then it will not be ""in the public interest"" to charge.

3272,4104,"Specific questions:  &gt;\- How % of the downpayment would be good to have? I'm thinking about £15,000, and then save a bit of money just in case some repairing is needed.  We call it a deposit (just to avoid any confusion).  There is no set rule but in general you want as big a deposit as possible to a) have a better chance of mortgage being agreed and b) get better interest rates.  Anything from 5-10% is minimum really.  15-25% is good.  25%+ is great.  40%+ is normally where you get the best mortgage rates so often little value in going beyond this.  You will often need to prove where the money has come from as part of the legal paperwork later in the process.  The general rule of thumb is that lenders will go up to 4.5x your before-tax (gross) income.  If you have a particularly good deposit or have other risk-reducing factors (good solid job, etc) then they may go beyond this, with some pushing up to 6x.  This is where broker advice is very useful.  You can get a mortgage ""in principle"" at any point (many do this before even starting viewings), but you don't apply for a mortgage until you've offered on a place.    For the mortgage, you should go via a broker, many of whom are free to the consumer (they get their commission from the lender with no costs passed on to you).  If you think your status as a non-national might complicate things (e.g. poor credit record), you might want to consider more specialist brokers, who may charge a fee of £500-£1500.  So for your proposed situation:  £155,000 property price.  £15,000 deposit is OK (just under 10%) but a little more, say up to £20k would really help.  If you put down a £15k deposit you need a mortgage of £140,000, which means you generally need to be earning above £31,100 gross.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;\- How much solicitor or all legal stuff might cost? I have no clue!  Somewhere between £1000 and £3000, depending on complexity and what sort of solicitor/conveyancer you instruct and including cost of surveyors (which you'll often instruct separately).    &amp;#x200B;  &gt;\- I would like to ask for a discount on the price, how much would be appropriate (not offensive)?  It is normal to offer below asking price.  Every seller has different motivations:  some want a quick sale, whereas some others might be willing to hold out for a high price.  Offering 10% below is normal.  20% below is starting to push it and you may be seen as not serious.   If you offer below, you might often explain why.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;\- What legal documents should I check about it?  Legal stuff will all be dealt with by your solicitor/conveyancer.    &amp;#x200B;  About the process:  The process is long (months), complicated, and painful.  Note that until stage 7, there is no legal or contractual obligation and either party can pull out or unilaterally change e.g. price for any reason.    1. Buyer views property, and asks questions to the estate agent who will pass them to the seller.  Seller may or may not be present during viewings.  At this stage there is no formal paperwork and it can be a pain to get important information as there is no legal requirement to provide full details at this stage. 2. If they like it, the buyer makes an offer.  Seller considers.  There may be a period of price negotiation, and then seller accepts.  **Nothing is legally binding at this point.**    3. Buyer applies for a mortgage.  Mortgage lender will instruct a valuing surveyor, consider the application, and come back with an answer in a few weeks.  Most buyers should do this via a broker as it is usually free and has zero downsides.   4. After this or at same time, buyer selects and instructs a conveyancer and/or solicitor who deals with all of the paperwork, legal issues, local searches, etc.  This includes many steps and can take months.  Seller will also instruct their own solicitor.   5. During this period the buyer (and often the seller) will usually employ their own surveyor to look at and value the property (and this will be more thorough than the mortgage survey which is often just a cursory check to make sure it's not a scam/fraud). 6. Buyer will also use this period to find out more detail about the property, measure up for furniture, negotiate over what is and isn't included (e.g. are they leaving beyond appliances) etc.  All of this is done via the solicitors/conveyancers and estate agents, and there are various forms and paperwork that need to be completed.  You generally won't have direct contact between buyer and seller.  **Still nothing is legally binding**. 7. Buyer and seller may make further price negotiations, if e.g. surveyors have found problems that will need to be fixed or if the seller wants to try it on and try and extract a higher price (shitty move but not illegal). 8. When both parties are happy with the price and conditions, they will ""exchange contracts"".  This is when they sign the contract, and agree on a move-in date.  **This is the first point in the process where there is now a legal obligation and pulling out after this incur costs.**  9. The final part is **completion***,* which can be the same day as the exchange or a week or two later.  This is when you get the keys and move in.   10. There may be questions or new problems that arise after the sale (suddenly find out house is collapsing), which may result in legal claims.  *In general*, unless the seller has misled on any of the paperwork, the buyer buys a property ""caveat emptor"" aka ""buyer beware"":  it was their and their surveyor's responsibility to find faults before agreeing to the purchase.   Again at this stage communication will still be through the solicitors and estate agents, rather than directly between buyer and seller.  The whole process can take months and is stressful for all parties involved; average seems to be 3ish months, but you hear of some sales taking upward of 9 maybe even longer than a year.  The biggest delaying factor is often if you have a chain, for example if the seller is also buying a new property - this makes things complicated as you often have to orchestrate a completion date on the same day on multiple properties all of the way up the chain.",1615665214,LegalAdviceUK,gqtun6w

He went into hospital after several days of vomiting and diarrhoea, he couldn't eat a thing, was confused and was complaining of pains in his abdomen. We didn't know how much pain he was actually in, he was one of these blokes who shrugged off pain and tried to ignore it/told everyone he was fine.   Anyway on the Tuesday him and my mum went to an iron maiden concert, he ordered a beer and shortly afterwent to the toilet and told my mum he had diarrhoea, they ditched the concert and went back to their hotel, where he started vomiting (he mentioned there was blood in his vomit, he thought he had a stomach ulcer).  Anyway a few days later he still wasn't better and confusion began, so on Saturday morning they were driven to A&amp;E where there was considerable debate over his diagnosis (a diagnosis was never found at the hospital). He arrived at the hospital with good stats but his lactate level was 14 (it should be around 2 I believe?). Whilst at the hospital he declined significantly and after many scans a diagnosis was still not found, no one knew what was wrong with him. Due to significant levels of acid in his blood an emergency blood transfusion was requested, this transfusion came 8 hours after it was requested, my step dad died 2 hours after receiving it. This was less than 15 hours after he was admitted.  A sample of his blood was taken by the A&amp;E department and went to blood bank for inspection. Blood bank phoned A&amp;E and requested another sample, that message wasn't passed on. So basically blood bank were waiting for another sample and A&amp;E were waiting for blood.   The hospital opened an investigation into his death and me and my family attended a meeting at the hospital where the whole case was discussed, the basic conclusion was that they thought my step dad had an ischemic bowel, so whether he had a transfusion of not wouldn't have mattered.  I believe, however, that it could have stabilised his metabolic acidosis enough so that he could have had exploratory surgery and at least given him some sort of a chance.   We decided we couldn't go down the legal route as it would have caused so much pain for us, everyone was devastated at the quickness of his death, and at the end of the day it wouldn't have brought him back.

3370,4230,"Understood. Also worth clarifying what time it was - was the sun still up? All those kinds of issues. Not because Reddit really needs to know, but because it’s good to write down as clear an account as you can shortly after the incident before your memory can be changed.   I note your concern is re criminal prosecution, not a civil claim so will focus only on that. Whilst many people have pointed out that the other vehicle was illegally on the road - that doesn’t necessarily mean there is no danger of you being done for careless driving or something similar. It’s not clear from your post what jurisdiction you are in so laws may vary between the 3 jurisdictions, but on a practical level it seems unlikely the police will take action against you. They have clear action they can and should take against the other party and in practice are unlikely to take action against both of you.  Legally, if they judge that the evidence suggest your driving fell below the standard of care  which would be expected of a reasonable driver then they may charge you. If it was pitch black, no natural light and no light sources (country road etc) then from what you’ve said it seems unlikely they would come to such a judgment. If the scooter was on the wrong side of the road then that helps further. You are unlikely to go far wrong by explaining that you stopped, looked both ways, and then proceeded having seen nothing coming on the road. The details about the incident being in pitch black (if so) with the scooter having no lights and all black clothing are important as well, as are your respective speeds. I imagine it was not possible for you to judge the speed of the scooter having not seen it until impact. How did you come to judge 20mph? If because a witness said as much, you should make that clear.  I agree with the other poster who suggested that you phone the police directly and enquire about why you have been sent a questionnaire rather than called in for interview etc. It may be due to Covid, but I am still unclear why they wouldn’t do something over the phone. Perhaps another poster in the police may have better knowledge on that front.",1615655819,LegalAdviceUK,gqtco1d

3372,4232,"NAL.  It is a ballache; let me explain broadly how it works (in order!):  1. You approach a mortgage broker and get what's called an ""agreement in principle"".  This means the bank is quite happy to loan you the money provided you meet all their other conditions.  Be warned not all mortgages will let you rent out rooms, so you need to tell your broker you need a product that will let you do that.  You will usually be able to borrow anything from 3-5x your annual pre-tax salary and (depending on the amount of deposit) you may have to pay more interest.  Your mortgage broker will want proof of income (usually payslips). 2. You find a house you like and make an offer.  Nobody expects you to offer full asking price - 3-5% would not be an unusual amount to knock off.  You an always make a bigger offer if your first one is refused. 3. Once it's agreed, you instruct a solicitor.  Expect to pay \~£800 +VAT and expenses.  Houses are sold ""as seen"" in the UK; your solicitor will therefore spend some time checking basic things like ""is the house on top of an abandoned mineshaft?"" and ""does the person selling the house own it in the first place?"".      1. Your solicitor will want proof of where your deposit is coming from (so they know you're not laundering money).  If you've been saving up for a few years, a bank statement proving it should suffice. 4. You'll also have to tell your mortgage company you've found the house you want and ask them to go ahead; they will instruct a surveyor.  The mortgage company's survey will be very basic: think ""Is there actually a house there?"".  They will often offer you the option of a more extensive survey, though it will be rather dearer.  This survey will be carried out at your expense.  You will also have to pay any application fees for the mortgage at this stage. 5. Several months later, you will exchange contracts.  Your solicitor will talk you through what everything means, and will want your deposit before you can exchange contracts.      1. Until such time as you have exchanged contracts, anyone can pull out of the transaction - only once exchanged is it legally binding.  ""Completion"" (the day where money changes hands and you actually get the keys and can move in) usually takes place a couple of weeks after exchange.    2. Around the time of exchange, your solicitor will want their fees paid.  British homes are usually not sold with basics like white goods (washing machine, fridge/freezer) or curtains - though you may be able to negotiate this as part of the buying process.  If you can't agree this, then you'll need to budget for it as soon as you move in.",1615655652,LegalAdviceUK,gqtccxv

You can, if you want, trot off to court and ask for an interim injunction to stop work until they correctly serve notice etc. That's expensive though, plus involves giving undertakings which most people are uncomfortable with given their involve a potentially unlimited financial exposure.  The other angle is that failure to follow process can flip the burden of proof of damages are claimed subsequently. So where generally it's on me to show damage to my house was caused by your works, if you should have served notice and didn't then the court will expect you to show that you didn't cause the damage (unless it's very obviously not related). The logic is they if you had followed procedure then there would have been a schedule of condition which showed if the damage existed already.

Yeah you always have to get one if you’re doing work that is substantially more than repainting your side/ shelves up etc. Or if you’re excavating within a particular distance and depth from the wall itself.

Whether they are going to go through their insurance to cover the cost or use their own capital is entirely down to them.

Any lapse on that sort of information, or witness to any delaying tactics, ask for their insurancve details directly. If they fail to provide, you call the police.

3535,4429,"As someone who advises on Wills all day long, the advice is usually fairly specific for each person's needs.   For a solicitor to draft a will you are looking at £100 to £200. It is by far the cheapest (per hour) thing you can do at a firm and is usually a loss leader.   As a litigator, the sentence ""not much point doing it professionally"" is why I have a job. Contentious probates are common and a large chunk of my day is spent dealing with mistakes in wills. Many of those disputes take years and often bankrupt the estate (Bleak House is a popular novel for a reason!).   Having said that, the wishes you describe are relatively usual but worth checking with a solicitor. Without seeing the draft you have made, we can't really say whether the wording is appropriate. I would always advise professional advice. We cannot know what other details might be relevant to your situation.   Wills law is Victorian and has over 100 years of case law on how clauses are interpreted etc.   With your specific query, you do not have to be specific with assets if you do not want to. ""all my estate to X if they shall survive me by X days"" is sufficient.   A statutory trust until your children turn 18 is normal. But anything older than 18 will attract tax as a discretionary trust.   Bear in mind that some assets do not pass via Will. E.g. assets held as joint tenants (property or bank accounts usually) and anything held in trust (pensions, life insurance etc).

Be careful with getting any work done now however, you’re essentially a) covering up evidence should directions be made for an expert report b) it’s better to know how much you’re working with once you’re awarded an amount if you are successful  Hope this helps!

I'm afraid I think we will just have to disagree on what the person is implying here - I think these words are, in this context intended to intimidate the OP to drop his case, by trying to appropriate the reputation of the profession of solicitors in England. Australian-qualified is a weak disclaimer to try and sow doubt (successfully!) as to guilt.  For me, it is the fact that he put the term solicitor on the bottom of a letter involving proceedings which forms part of the implication as to the deception; it would be quite different for one to put that on their executive biography (which I agree would not be caught).  I think the average person who sees someone purporting to be a solicitor, in these circumstances, will expect them to be authorised to act as such - why would you use that term as a sign off, unless you wanted to try and use that profession's reputation to advance your case?  That the OP was not in fact misled, I do not think is the issue - it's that the person has tried to imply he was by putting the title down. As you say, people don't regularly look it up, so in my view this goes to his wilful conduct in implying that he is qualified to act.  I think the analysis of qualification being a technical issue similar to being part of one's CV is a fig leaf used to mask his actual intent: to bully people into thinking he's an actual solicitor impliedly one who is authorised to - to rely on it being a simple neutral statement at face value (in this case) defeats the purpose of the offence.",1615639347,LegalAdviceUK,gqslbuf

3563,4460,"I think the application of a modicum of common sense would tell someone that laws differ from country to country, so where you are qualified isn’t simply an interesting biographical fact about where you studied.  From a practical point of view, (a) this practice is more or less universal, as far as I can tell, whereas one would have expected the SRA to take steps if it were a criminal offence and (b) the fact of qualification in another jurisdiction is obviously relevant information which people should be permitted to communicate, and not be caught out by the (essentially arbitrary) fact that the role in the other jurisdiction is also called “solicitor”.   If we break the section down:  &gt; **Unqualified person not to pretend to be a solicitor.**  &gt; Any unqualified person who wilfully pretends to be, or takes or uses any name, title, addition or description implying that he is, qualified or recognised by law as qualified to act as a solicitor shall be guilty of an offence  So the two ways of committing the offence are:   * Pretending to be (qualified etc) to act as a solicitor.   * Taking on a name etc implying that you are.   The former just clearly isn’t made out, it seems to me: saying “I am an Australian-qualified solicitor” just isn’t pretending to be a solicitor of the Senior Courts of England &amp; Wales.   So you have to hang your hat on the latter – that you have taken or used a title or description *implying* that you are (or, at the very least, implying that you are qualified to act as one). Again, objectively those words on their own don’t imply that, so you have to rely on a sort of general ignorance which just don’t think exists.   You mention OP’s case, but if anything I think that proves my point: people don’t actually regularly look up *every* person using the word “solicitor”, and I doubt that’s what OP did.

Upon some further digging of the lease document and contract, they say that the lease term was 125 years in 2010 when the flat was build, so there's at least 114 years remaining which seems more than enough. I was panicking a bit last night when I saw the 85 years number so I feel better now. This whole leasehold stuff looks to be such shit but it shouldn't affect us now so there's that at least.

Only a breathalyzer test can prove if he was over the limit.    The police won’t do much to my knowledge.  If anything they’ll tell you to speak to victim support and victim support can send u panic alarms n give you other suggestions about keeping safe.   You could ask for the police to be present to prevent the breach of the peace. However unless someone actually shows threats of violence then it’s unlikely they act on anything, especially cos your in a private dwelling n not in public so breach of the peace is also unlikely to happen as he’d need to show some threats of violence.  Even though he scares you, in the police perspective he has not committed a crime so they won’t help much I don’t think. When u kick someone out of ur home then it’s more of a civil matter than criminal so not much police can do.   I’d ring 101 if I was you n explain everything.

If you stay even a few hours beyond this, then you move onto a rolling periodic tenancy.  If this happens, you now need to give 1 month notice (assuming you pay rent monthly).

3855,4812,"It is a bit strange to have a 3 month notice period.  I suspect the landlord is not actually able to require that.  There are four scenarios, only two very specific ones of which where you could possibly need to give 3 months notice:  1. If you are on a fixed term, then the **only** time a 3 month notice period could be required is if you are exercising your right under a break clause. 2. If you are on a fixed term, you can move out at the end of the fixed term without giving **any** notice (although a month is common courtesy).   3. If your fixed term has ended and you are now on a rolling periodic tenancy and pay rent monthly, then you almost always need to give 1 rental period's notice (i.e. 1 month notice).  Unless:   4. Your fixed term tenancy had a special clause setting out that when it finishes it gives rise to a new contractual periodic tenancy with a 3 month notice period.  This is pretty rare.      or 5. You pay rent every 3 months on your periodic tenancy  So, unless you're enacting a break clause, you are on a special *contractual* periodic tenancy, or you pay rent every 3 months, the landlord has no power to require you to give 3 months notice no matter how much they whine or claim that they can.

If it's a more serious form of burglary (serial burglar, high value items stolen, place ransacked, other aggravating factors, etc) then the starting point for sentencing will be above the magistrates' power and so they would almost certainly kick it up to the crown court.

This is exactly the case though? Company has had the benefit of a more qualified employee after the course ended so they cannot argue that they are at a 100% loss on the training.  These contract clauses are only allowed for companies to recover a reasonable loss they have made, not so they can double dip and profit from employees leaving.  They can only reclaim costs up to 2 years on a sliding scale basis, if OP is leaving after a year then at most they can claim is half the course cost, but ofc if OP's contract doesn't say that then it's likely an unfair contract clause. If they left a week before the 2 years was up it'd hardly be reasonable for the company to expect a full reimbursement for the course would it?  I'd even go so far as to say I can imagine if it went far enough and the contract was legal, a tribunal would probably side with an employee if they could prove that the company was not at a loss because the qualification allowed them to be charged out at a much higher rate than previous, which meant the company already more than covered it's cost on the training course at the point of the employee leaving, so there is no loss to recover.",1615587894,LegalAdviceUK,gqqnjs2

However the landowner has since accused me of trespass to even have seen the sign.   I’ve looked it up and the road I walked along to get to the sign / entrance to the lot is a public bridleway so the landowner is making a false accusation and clearly trying to intimidate and scare people away from the area if every rambler who enquires about the application form gets told you were trespassing to see this sign how dare you and now I have your name and address.   I understand having entered the grounds previously I’m hardly in the right (to be clear I have no plans to enter again). But this behaviour absolutely makes my blood boil (he happens to be very rude as well I don’t think I’d be so bothered otherwise) - by making false accusations and being intimidating can I get the landowner in any trouble?

You can certainly inform them that their tenant appears to be running a laundry business, but whether they'll do anything about it is really up to them.  &gt;Will I need concrete proof?  The usual route is contacting your local council and making a noise complaint. They will probably ask you to keep a noise diary for 30 days or so, then they'll send out a team with mics to measure the actual noise levels. If these are found to be excessive, your neighbour will be served with a warning notice, then a fixed penalty notice, then finally prosecuted if she doesn't keep it quiet. At this point, her landlord may choose to end the tenancy due to anti-social behaviour, but they might not.  &gt;is this just one of those things I have to either suck up and accept or move?

From personal experience I had to go through 3 failed repairs with one company (not HP) before they finally accepted the product was not fit for purpose and they replaced it.

I thought it couldve been argued that we are compelled by not only the other citizens that choose to drive and exercise that privilege, and naturally the repercussions of state law, which I thought were void in reference to a constitutional right.

Little did I know that I was creating a trust fund. The lawyer also misled me to believe that he’s handling my father’s estate and didn’t tell me that he’s only representing my mother.

My mother moved thousands of miles overseas after I signed the Trust Agreement, and it took her over 2 years to send me an accounting of the Trust fund after multiple requests.

They left the house in immaculate condition so we are planning on honoring the lease and returning their security deposit. The only thing that needs to be taken out is fees for cleaning the carpets, and repainting which they didn’t do (their cat had scraped the paint off of every corner in the house with its claws).

4453,5496,Generally speaking when you have an accident that is not your fault you can either file through your insurance company or through the at fault party's insurance company.  If you file through your insurance company it can go one of two ways.  If fault is not in dispute (both insurance companies agree that you are not at fault) then your insurance company pays you for the damage to your car (or pays a shop to fix it) and then the other company reimburses them.  This is what happened in your accidents.  If fault is being disputed (your insurance company says it isn't your fault but the other guy says it is) then you pay your deductible and it is handled as a normal comprehensive or collision claim.  Then your insurance company attempts to collect through the at fault party or their insurance and if they succeed then they refund you your deductible.  If they are unable to collect you are out your deductible and depending upon your state's laws you may or may not get surcharged as if you were at fault for the damage.

If not, send him a stern but respectful text/email/letter regarding his breach of your agreement and your desire to get your money back. In the letter/message, recount the timeline of events and explain clearly why he's in breach. Tell him that he has a certain number of days to respond to you or else you'll go to a lawyer and, if necessary, take him to court. Keep the tone serious/professional and leave emotion out of it. Tell him that you would prefer to resolve this without involving attorneys and the courts.  And then if those efforts are unsuccessful, you can consult with an attorney or look into handling the small claims court yourself.

Despite the fact it is worthwhile to realize that HR is a company employee and thus, like all other workers, is there to benefit the company -- you're missing two ***extremely*** important facts in discouraging people from trusting HR or reporting to them.   First, HR's interest in protecting the company is abiding the law, *meaning that the company's best interest and an employee's best interest are very closely aligned a vast majority of the time.* Second, and much, ***much*** more importantly, in most cases of a dispute that could become a legal issue, employees are required to make reports through the appropriate channels - supervisor, HR, manager, what have you. HR tends to be central for escalating disputes in almost any company, so telling someone ""HR is there to protect themselves and not you,"" you are ***discouraging people from utilizing a channel that they have an exceptionally high likelihood of having a legal requirement to go through in attempt to resolve a dispute prior to involving the legal system or authority.*** This ""advice"" gets read as ""don't go to HR with a problem"" and can royally fuck someone with an issue such as sexual harassment or other HWE concerns, disability accommodation, etc. Failing to attempt to resolve through appropriate channels -- i.e. Human Resources -- can make it so that an employee has no recourse legally because they failed to attempt resolution through the appropriate channels first.

4971,6124,"IANAL, but have been through a divorce that went through many stages of amicable and well, very not that. Ultimately we used a mediator for some of it.  First, your emotions are totally expected. Just realize that a lot can change. And that my telling you that is, well, probably worthless. I would not expect you to have made any ""progress healing"" at this point. You're still in what a friend calls the ""hit by a truck phase."" It will get better and worse and better. Ultimately better. If someone had just told me that at the beginning... well they did and I didn't really believe them and it didn't help. ;) But it is true.  Second, this puts you in a bad spot to make long-term financial decisions. You probably want to slow down on the financial stuff and first get the kid stuff in order. Do you have the custody arrangement you want? This is really important.  Third, your financial stuff sounds maybe odd?, maybe ok?, but there's not enough detail to opine on its fairness. Are you trading $20,000 in truck and $50,000 in 401(k) for $300,000 in home equity? Or is the 50 percent of the 401k plus the truck roughly equal to the home equity? I understand that you want to keep her and your child in the home and in town, but I would put a limit of how much I'd sacrifice financially for it. Perhaps there is another way for her to even up on the home equity, that's a good one for a lawyer. Also, your description doesn't include discussions of child support, which is quite important. If you agree to be generous on the assets and she is super aggressive on the support, the deal might not be as fair as you hope. (I gave up some of my asset claims because she was being unreasonable, but it was not worth going to court over, so I get you giving up some money to do the right thing for your child.)  Fourth, some lawyers do give a free hour consultation to see if there's a fit. It's not ok for it to be unclear about whether you're paying or not.  Fifth, consider jointly hiring a lawyer as a mediator -- that gives you the ability to ask the mediator privately questions like, hey, what would I likely get in court on this issue, or is there a creative way to get me a fairer share of the equity without her having to move, or if I give her this equity in the house, how do I know she won't move in a year anyway?  So what to do? Consider 1) telling your wife's attorney in writing that you need time to think about the deal, that she is not authorized to take you off the deed or do anything unusual with joint accounts until you do, 2) consider filing the complaint yourself, as that usually freezes things until there is an agreement, but that depends on your state, 3) either hire a lawyer or consider jointly hiring a lawyer as a mediator.

You should be happy they're not considering it an interest-bearing loan, or just saying ""well, you didn't have that money to work with in the first place, so your winnings are void."" If that latter part had been the case, that *might* be something you could contest legally, i.e. 'I left the cashier with the expectation that I bought credit, and whereas I *should* have noticed that I hadn't paid for it, you can't now tell me I don't benefit from the gains I realised from using it.')   Bottom line, you're square where you should be. And to answer your question, ""why do I have to make sure they do their job right?"" well, that goes to both sides. It's in *your* best interest to ensure everything was done right before you leave the cashier's cage.   [Look at this from another angle: that of the counterfeit bill. Despite numerous safeguards in the industry to prevent counterfeits from getting around *there's always a slim chance* that you could receive a bad bill. If you don't inspect (while counting!) those bills, right then and there, and catch one, in general you're on the hook once you accept it. Plenty of stories about banks being accused of passing a bad bill to a customer, who then leaves, comes back an hour later with their claim, and the bank says 'no' to replacing it. And rightfully so. USSS holds the position that ""whoever holds it, loses."" So never find yourself holding it! :)]  That's the end of legal advice discussion.

And I know it's hard to resist the urge to 'take advantage' of mistakes made by ""Big Biz"" with flimsy rationalizations. ""Oh, the casino makes millions, they can spare $300."" Or checking out at the grocery store and the cashier gives you your original bill back, *along with* your change and the purchase. ""They'll be OK without that $50."" But, beyond the fact that those types of mistakes can often cost an employee their job, no matter how big or small, you've gotten something that you shouldn't have, and you have to look at yourself in the mirror every day. Remember that someday the tables could be turned, and you'll be thankful someone 'did the right thing' and got your lost property/money back to you! Or corrected your change when you give back too much. Or whatever.  It actually bugs me a bit when someone says, ""thank you for doing the right thing,"" like it's so unheard of, but unfortunately, it generally is these days.

Lawyers charge for divorce consultations to at least slow down that possibilities that a jilted spouse won't try to black list out all attorneys in the area.   You've been married for almost a decade. That's almost a decade of marital assets you need divided. There's a good possibility that alimony could be awarded if you're in a better financial position than she is.

My attorney originally told me that we could send the defendant an offer to settle once they were served, but then my lawyer didn't allow this, and has instructed me to not communicate with the defendant.   Question: if I tell my lawyer I don't wish to pursue the case anymore, is the case thrown out and it goes away? Could I file for partition again if needed? (I understand the defendant could decide to come after me).  Next question: What I really want to do is try to speak with and negotiate with the defendant directly to work things out, and hopefully reach some agreements or settlement. How should I go about this given the situation? Other folks settle their cases before it proceeds very far, why can I not do this in my situation? Thanks",1615982025,legaladvice,gr87hc2

If you aunt takes 33% of the net value of estate, that would maybe be a fair compensation for her time invested. Sadly, many states only offer garbage, lowball executor fees based on some arbitrary calculation. It sucks working your ass off for people that don't appreciate how time consuming the task is.   Sorry for venting at you, but the title is virtuous in the beginning, especially when you truly cared for the deceased. However, by the middle of the process, the third parties that need to be dealt with make it a nightmare.   An accounting.  Haha. I hope she is a patient woman.",1615962209,legaladvice,gr7mu8e

As to why I'd be fined.    First, the vehicle has never been registered by the roommate after he purchased the vehicle, the PO passed away after the purchase so the car is technically in a limbo state of ""who actually owns it"" till it's registered.   Second, since I am the sole person on the lease, I am responsible for the visual upkeep of the property IE yard work, broken cars, etc.     Also I picked vacate for the terminology here, because I asked them to leave if they refused to pay me owed rent (recorded verbal contract for rent) as I refuse to pay for the home by myself. Since they refused to pay, I am moving to a cheaper rental home the landlords own once this lease is up on April 15th + 1 additional month (paying month to month) while they finish renovating the other home.      Now, if they refuse to leave by the 8th then I can start the eviction process.... which is going to be a nightmare for me, as I was dumb and never got written or recorded permission from the landlord, so if I involve the landlords they could bite me in the ass and go after me for breach of contract.

And then before you know it the hearing is over and you wait...and three to five weeks later the judges temporary orders are handed down and they are talking about how it’s so important for a child to have meaningful time with both parents and that they’re ordering immediate and consistent contact between child and dad AND to top it all off you’ve kind of gotten off on the wrong foot and made yourself look bad because you’re the one who took “drastic action” and “ripped this poor child out of his home, school, and social life” and so on.   THEN it could take *years* to slog through the whole thing depending on how contentious things actually get, and with the first move being “taking the child and fleeing to another state” I’m guessing it could get pretty contentious.   You’ve got to stop and really think *before* you start making moves. Just taking off because this dude is scary solves very little in the short term and potentially places you and your child in a *very difficult position* long term.   Can you prove abuse? Can you prove that he is unfit? How?   You will be shocked by how unmoved the court seems by your insistence that he is a monster. Don’t assume you are automatically a sympathetic character who will be believed or taken for your word. That’s not how it works.  IANAL, just a tired mom who has been going through a nasty contentious divorce from my abuser for over three years. It has cost me over $100k and I have PROOF of his abuse. He admitted to it as a part of a plea deal in criminal proceedings and even with his arrest and many DV charges and CPS findings of abuse against him it has still been very difficult to get anything done.  If I could go back in time I would have prepared myself WAY differently to leave him. I could have saved myself a lot of money and heartache if I’d thought harder and better prepared myself.  My advice to you is to consult with two different divorce attorneys in your home state before you do *anything* else and choose the one you go with wisely—then do exactly what they say. Child custody cases are no joke.   Be wary of GALs. They’re not always what they seem, don’t assume they’re good people. They’re just people, sometimes people suck, but in this case they’re sucky people who have a lot of power over what happens in your case.   You *should* leave.

Many of our local chapters lost the tax exemption because they failed to file their tax return for three straight years.  If you visit the IRS website they have information on reinstatement.  Depending on how recently you had your exemption revoked it may be possible to have it retroactively reinstated.  If too much time has passed then you can still get it reinstated but there would be a period where it was not a tax exempt organization.  Some of our local officers were able to do this on their own but others hired an accountant to help them navigate the paperwork.

I emailed him in January to remind him that my husband never complied and that I saw no point in scheduling mediation until I had received his financial disclosure. So he had his paralegal reach out to me last month about mediation and I again said no disclosure, no mediation. So they immediately scheduled a hearing to compel mediation where the judge only let me get two words out and then ordered mediation for next month. Then the jackass scheduled another hearing to move it up a week for this hearing. This time I’m going to make sure that I get an opportunity to clarify that he’s in violation of a court order to submit his financial docs and that it’s ludicrous to go into mediation when I don’t know what’s on the table.  I think his lawyer’s gambit is to muscle me into mediation when I don’t have a lawyer (because his asshole client isn’t paying CS or spousal maintenance so I can’t afford one).

Fuck that!I’ve spent way too much time studying up on the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, so I’ll be better prepared for this hearing.

He has already paid arrears twice, but the conditions were different each time. The first time, we had to wait 6 months to meet with the OAG satellite office for a standard 3-year review. The caseworker adjusted the child support and then made it retroactive to the date our meeting had been scheduled six months earlier.  The next time, I filed pro se with the court for several modifications, including a child support review. The judge said that since I hadn't hired a process server, the earliest date that it could be retroactive to was our first court appearance for that modification. (So whatever you do, be sure to hire a server. Don't hand deliver it yourself.) Ten months later, the judge granted the increase and 9 months of arrears.  Currently, the OAG's office is pursuing the usual 3-year review. My ex refused to comply, so two months later, the OAG sued him and had him served. He's hired an attorney who is deliberately dragging his feet (waiting all 21 days to file a response to the suit notice, waiting all 50 days to produce the discovery documents requested in the notice of lawsuit). To me, these delays seem intentional and strategic-- so does his lawyer see some sort of advantage to stalling? If so, what? Each of the previous times, he's owed arrears.

You're two issues will be who is the insured party, you or her? And why are you out of state? If you are named as the insured party, even if you're part of her insurance, and you are out of state with residential status (like going to college) as opposed to on vacation or whatever, then you should be able to just transfer your prescription. And you get one or two emergency do-overs a year with most insurance policies. So for instance if a prescription refill got redirected in properly or was being held by one's family member or accidentally fleshed down the toilet or spilled in the litter box, you can usually get a replacement fill.  The best place to start is with the pharmacy number on your old prescription bottle. Call up and talk to the pharmacist and they can give you practical advice at the level before any sort of legal entanglements are involved. the pharmacist has a reasonable duty of privacy regarding you and their conversations so they don't even have to inform your parents or whatever given that you're an adult. Just explain to them what's going on calmly and they are probably a very simple solution.  Believe me the pharmacist has seen more and more-convoluted circumstances than you might imagine.

Issue 1 is pretty easy. The write up signature is typically only to acknowledge the write-up, and not necessarily an admission of bad behavior. Failure to sign is typically insubordination, which is a valid thing to discipline for.  Issue 2 is more challenging. If the employer has a policy to report harassing behavior (like most employers do), then failure to do so could lead to discipline. I don't love applying discipline from a policy standpoint...

6169,7514,"Sure, you could argue that the agreement to pay the body shop directly was a settlement for only vehicle damages, and that any other claims for medical costs, diminished vehicle value, or substitute transportation were reserved to be settled separately.  You have no other separate agreements, verbal or written.   So you're suing on the basis of auto collision liability, not breach of contract.  When people really do agree to settle this kind of dispute without insurance, they virtually always enter into a ""settlement of claims"" that covers the breadth of possible claims and explicitly forecloses either party's ability to make future claims in court.  The other driver will surely claim that they intended to settle the entire dispute by paying for your vehicle repairs.  A judge will decide if that agreement infers a total settlement, or narrowly only the collision damage described within the four corners of the document.   If you were suing for all of your damages at once, I would side with you.   Because you entered into a partial settlement without addressing the rest of your expenses, I side with them.     One thing you have to be careful about using as leverage is the AZ financial responsibility law.   If you win in court and the other party doesn't pay, then you can ask for their license to be suspended because they were driving uninsured and caused a collision.  DO NOT threaten to use that as leverage, like ""I will sue and win and get your license suspended if you don't settle"".   That's uncomfortably close to extortion, and you don't have the leverage until *after* you win a judgment *and* they don't pay.  In some states you can use that leverage up front because you can request a suspension before you go to court, if there's a substantial probability that you will prevail.

Whether that would be successful or not is hard to speculate on - verbal agreements for real estate usually aren't enforceable as such, but arguments like a constructive trust may be valid - but it'll complicate your life.

That being said, the punishment for violating that section is not denial of entry to the US. If you’re a US citizen, they’re going to let them back in; even if he doesn’t have a passport. They may just follow up with a civil penalty later, particularly if OP explains that it was intentional.   Of course, it also assumes his other nationality allows travel without a visa or ETSA; and that the airline will allow him to fly without proof of ability to enter the US. I envision OP showing their other passport to the airline desk and then them asking “ok, where’s your entry visa?”, then denying them boarding when they explain they don’t need one because they are a US citizen, just don’t have any proof.   Passport-less entries work a lot better at land POEs.   OP, the usual advice is to fly to a city with an official “[Passport Agency](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast/passport-agencies.html)” run by the state department, which can literally give you a same day passport in exigent circumstances when you have travel in only a few days.

A judge is going to see that 1) you are not in compliance with the law, 2) that the household of you, your dad, and your grandpa is not working in a way to have you attend school and 3) you have missed 4 years (a lot!) of school. Unfortunately, anyone seeing that is going to say that you are better off with your mom. At least you might start going to school again.  I know it may not happen, but you need a lawyer who has experience with this and can work to negotiate a way for you to be most successful.

Putting notice to terminate your tenancy inside some other routine document, such as a satisfaction survey, without calling attention to it is probably not going to be viewed as reasonable, because there's no reason the landlord should have been specifically expecting this kind of critical information to be contained in a survey answer.  Your email about it is probably valid notice, but that'd be dated today if you sent it today, not backdated to the original survey.

6848,8312,"At best, realistically, would be compensation for the rights to film a scene like this in a building like yours. If there are actual damages that can be proven, perhaps a case could be won with a judgement beyond that, but whether there's a valid legal case against the production company (or another party) depends on the facts.  My understanding is the relevant laws differ substantially by state, as well as city/county. The production company likely needed a permit from a government agency. They almost certainly had that. They also would have likely needed an executed location release form signed by someone acknowledging they had the legal authority to grant the release and that no one else needed to authorize the release.  It's possible a location release form was signed by someone with the authority to grant access to film common areas and everything was legal. I saw the movie shortly after it was released, but I don't have a strong recollection of where the actors (and crew?) went inside the building. There would have been little logical reason for them to choose to film there without authorization since unless I'm forgetting something there was nothing about the scene for which your building was an essential element.  For sake of argument, let's assume they didn't get a valid release or they should have reasonably believed the release wasn't valid. You might have a claim for trespass or a privacy infringement...perhaps something else. You may be able to pursue compensation that would be typical for similar use. If they do have a release, you may have a claim against whoever signed it for the same claims - possibly for violation of lease terms if the signer was a tenant.  Beyond that, I'm uncertain your dad has a strong claim for any other damages. If he loses business because it's perceived that he (or the organization owning the building) authorized the filming or business is being lost because of the association with the film, he may have a claim, but that kind of claim may be very difficult to prove.",1615926693,legaladvice,gr5vo4v

If they can't develop probable cause for a warrant independent of your ""tips"", then if they want a warrant they will need to rely on you.   That includes naming you and giving the defendant the opportunity to ""face their accuser"" by having the defense cross-examine you in court about the basis of your statement to the police.  Police especially can't avoid their limitations under the 4th Amendment by having a civilian do warrantless snooping, then including that information without attribution.

My issue is that my brother has been effectively bilking my mother by pressuring her to continued mortgage payments and refusing to sell the house.  Knowing full well that the deed was Right of Survivorship.  I guess the best case scenario is he either sells the house giving back my mother’s money so she can Will it as she pleases.

Your first step should be to write them a letter (keep three copies) giving them a set time, say two weeks, to hand you a check, or you'll sue them.  Send it by certified mail and keep the receipt.  Get a note from the other dentist stating what work was actually done, and a copy of his bill showing that the work was done by him.  Make three copies of each of those things.  If they don't give you a check by the time you stated in the letter, head down to the local courthouse and ask the clerk how to file in small claims court.  It's usually just a matter of filling out some forms and paying a small fee (less than $100).  Include the filing fee in the amount of your claim.  If they don't settle before your court date, take your paperwork (letter, note, and bill, three copies each) to court and tell the judge what happened.

Your employer can fire you for any reason, or no reason at all, unless the reason is discriminatory or in violaton of public policy (and that last one can get murky). So if you told customers not to tip b/c you don't get the money...well you can be fired for that.  You should, however, contact the DOL's Wage &amp; Hour division and file a complaint.  They WILL investigate and your owner may be subjected to some stiff penalties.  If you take that route, ***firing you would be a violation of the Conscientous Employee Protection Act*** (NJ's whistelblower law) and subject the owner to further problems (including your ability to sue him for lost wages and counsel fees).  Tip theft is wage theft and it's illegal.  EDIT TO ADD:  You also mentioned your boba shop is a franchise.  If so, the owner's franchise agreement may contain language which requires him/her/it to comply with all federal, state, and local laws and the failure to do so is a material breach of the franchise agreement.  Franchises are heavily regulated and it's very hard to terminate one under the New Jersey Franchise Practices Act...but it's not impossible if you have good cause under the franchise agreement for the termination.  ""Stealing employee tips"" and getting fined by the DOL is probably good cause under the FPA to terminate.  What I'm saying is your employer is really taking a lot of risks with the tips that aren't financially feasible.",1615925387,legaladvice,gr5sty8

As to your bigger question on the false report, you should be very careful. Many, many criminal statutes in states all over the US have names that don't make a whole lot of sense or don't adequately describe how they are actually used. So while you may have been reported for ""vandalism,"" the actual allegation could include any number of things, one of which you may have done.  Now, I doubt any of this is going to go anywhere, but if a report gets filed (with the courts) against you, or you get a summons or a notice with a court date of any kind, absolutely get a lawyer involved. They will understand the technicalities of the statute in question.  Also, most businesses only save their videos for about 30 days, so the clock is ticking if you think the video will support your side.

7125,8651,"Insurance can be tricky to understand.  &gt;Now the insurance adjuster told us that they can only give my dad and my 2 uncles $10,000 split between them  This may be the policy limit.  If that's all that the teen was covered for, then that's all insurance can pay out.    &gt;The adjuster is pressuring us to sign the paper and wants all 3 them to sign them in order for them to get the money. My dad doesn’t want to sign it since he got his insurance to fix everything but without my dads signature my uncles won’t get any money?  It's hard to sort this bit out since this is second-hand info, but it's likely that what is included with this settlement is a release of liability, which basically says ""we've got all the money that we need and won't try to get any more"".  There may be some reason other than ""didn't want to"" that is keeping your dad from signing the paperwork, and this is something that your uncles and dad can sort out with the insurance company.  &gt;Anyway we can get a larger compensation? Lawyers?  It depends on why they're only offering 10K.  If it's the policy limit, then they'd have to take this money, and go after the driver himself (or his parents).  If it's *not* the policy limit, then they need to figure out why the offer is so low and make a counter-offer.  Your uncles also have the same option your dad did - go through their own insurance.  Since they *didn't*, I'm assuming that they don't have coverage for this incident.  It's rarely a bad idea to get a consult with a lawyer, and that's probably what I'd advice your uncles to do in this case.

(USA centric explanation, and specifically Florida but probably generally applicable)  A police investigator can certainly find something online and decide to start digging into records or other evidence that would be available to them. In fact, one of the cases I have pending right now was found in exactly this way, someone bragged about committing a (rather large) fraud, on Instagram.

If the office wants to subpoena records from Instagram, that's probably fine. Call up the local DA, convince them it's worth looking into, and in many states that's sufficient for a subpoena. In some states the court has to approve it, but even then it's usually a rubber stamp because a subpoena isn't particularly invasive to the party you are investigating.  But, say, a search warrant? That'd be another issue entirely. You'd have to demonstrate far more than just the social media post/admission, including how you can verify that the party you want to search is in fact the same one that made the post. Is that person pictured directly in the post? In the profile? Are they just named? Things get increasingly tenuous the farther you go down this line.  In the end, the real story is that it would depend on how big of a crime this is and whether the police investigator initially expects there to be any good evidence to find.

7384,8962,"Your mind is going to the right place in thinking about ""unilateral"" changes, but there are a few important factors to consider.  1) If it is deemed illegal to unilaterally revert to the original terms after agreeing to the modification, what is the remedy for the landlord? It would not be termination, it would be a claim for the amount owed for the electricity. They would have to sue for it which would probably cost more than the ~$1000/year difference the tenant is refusing to pay in electricity.  2) The reason for the so-called ""modification"" is related to the power dynamic of the landlord-tenant relationship. Fearing for their home security, the tenant agreed to something that was to their detriment. The landlord was the first one to state that they would not be abiding by the contract. **Arguably, and in my opinion, this is not actually agreeing to a modification, this is a breach of contract by the landlord, and the tenant was coerced into accepting the cost of the beach.** Both the first change and reverting back can be considered unilateral, but only one is supported by a written agreement. Furthermore, you must again remember that the remedy is not termination, it would be to compel one party or the other to pay for the electricity, and most of the pressure here is on the landlord.  3) Usually when a contract is modified, there must be new consideration (this is a contested area of law, I'm honestly not sure how this would go in Maine). For the non-lawyers here, consideration is an element of a contract that goes along with the other elements of the offer and acceptance. Usually consideration is money, but it generally just means some sort of advantage or benefit. So, in the original modification where the tenant says they'll pay the difference in the electric bill, what is the new consideration? There is none. The implied ""consideration"" is that the landlord won't evict them. The landlord is the one who is breaching. There is no fresh consideration in return for the tenant assenting to the landlord's refusal to abide by the contract and pay the electric bill.   4) Again, *practically,* because decision-makers have an acute awareness of the power dynamic in the landlord-tenant relationship, any ambiguity regarding contract law here will likely be in favour of the tenant and the landlord will have to spend a lot of time and money making a legal claim for less than $1000 in alleged damages. They will not be looked upon favourably by a judge or arbitrator who knows that they are there because they made a bad deal for themselves and now they're mad that it's costing them.  Landlord-tenant law is a unique area of law. It should not be viewed as something that will be dictated by the fundamental principals of contract. We're not talking about a multi-million dollar construction project, we're talking about a landlord who made a bad deal and tried to take advantage of their tenant. I've never heard of a landlord winning a case like this. More importantly, these things are usually not decided by the legal system, they are decided by both sides thinking about their non-legal options and making practical considerations to get what they want.",1615915450,legaladvice,gr56p9j

7517,9118,"As u/DiabloConQueso and u/wot-mothmoth write, YES, even if you purchase the dog with your separate account, it can be a marital asset.  But there are so many factors here.  State is important because equitable distribution versus community property.  Also if your separate account was pre-marital and generated by say, a personal injury settlement/award or a pre-marital inheritance--that account COULD be deemed separate, unless you commingled it.  How to commingle?  Deposit anything--even a penny--in it from the marriage.  Some states also provide that paying marital debts from a separate account could result in commingling too.  ALSO, you say soon to be ex-wife--was the divorce already commenced when you bought the puppy?  I know you say you just consulted with a lawyer, but it's not clear if that was regarding the divorce proceeding or whether it was for the puppy.  Some states have a look back period to the filing/service of the summons and complaint.    Very hard to answer your question on these facts.  Unfortunately, a dog is considered to be a chattel, or piece of personal property.  It is not a family member in that sense like a child.  I don't know any states who have puppy support or dog support, and most judges will not get involved in any type of dog custody arrangement at all.  BUT I do know of two judges personally known to me who HAVE done mediations and signed off on separation agreements involving a dog's time with the family.  This is very rare and really depends on the judge, but there is nothing in the law (at least that I am aware) compelling a judge to do this.  But remember, judges are people too and if you get a judge who has dogs or is an animal person, or a judge who has had other cases with this issue, there is the off chance that the judge could take it under consideration.  Again, this is the rare exception to the rule--most judges think a dog is beneath them to adjudicate and the law does not provide any remedy either other than community property/equitable distribution, which is unfortunate.  I am sorry you are going through this!  Do not do anything rash though because it can definitely affect your perception in the court.  Listen to your lawyer and take the highest road you can--it is your best chance to ever get the dog back.  I can assure you if you do anything unorthodox or anything that could be deemed hostile or aggressive towards your soon to be ex, it will not go unnoticed by the court--nor her attorney.  On the aside, you may want to let the place you adopted know your plight.  Some breeders may have sympathy and could give you a credit to adopting a future puppy (after the divorce, of course--otherwise we would just be repeating the marital property issue above).  It is a long shot, but you never know what a breeder might do to someone who clearly cares about the puppy like you do.  Be well and best of luck!",1615913389,legaladvice,gr51zl9

When she died, everything she owned became the property of something called Estate of Mom’s Name.Someone has to be appointed to be in charge of the estate.

That’s a simplified description of “probate.”  If the value of her estate was less than $75,000 a d there is enough money to pay all her debts (including final income taxes), you can use a [Small estate affidavit](https://texaslawhelp.org/article/small-estate-affidavits#toc-1). That’s a very simplified way to do it.  Her state does not include anything with a named beneficiary. That’s not the same as a joint account. It is a statement on the account that says “When I die So-and-So gets this.”  It’s usually things like bank &amp; brokerage accounts, retirement accounts, and life insurance. You’ve already got that.

It would be very hard for your employer to claw back wages and comp, or to impose punitive measures on you, but they _can_ claw back things like signing bonuses or the cost of for-your-benefit external training that they pay for on your behalf, up to a point.  However, an agreement can _claim_ to provide more than that, and arguing over its enforceability is a bad use of your time. Hence the lawyer - a couple hundred dollars now might save you thousands in the future. Giving it a professional once-over is insurance against that risk, because it means you'll know early if it's an unreasonable agreement you should walk away from or whether it's completely reasonble.  If you don't have the resources to hire someone - and it's fair if you don't - you might try your local university to see if they have a legal clinic, or try getting a referral from your province's law society to see if someone will do it on the cheap.

7679,9303,"First, you each need a will. Generally, married couples appoint each other as primary executor. The surviving parent would get custody of the children, unless there is a big problem.   I am another who thinks paying for an attorney is money well spent. Yes, the attorney may use boilerplate language, but it’s boilerplate that the attorney knows will keep the probate court happy.  There’s complexity in naming beneficiaries, an executor, and kids’ guardians. Speaking of boilerplate, this is some of mine:  When the beneficiaries are minors, the court usually wants their inheritance put into a trust, so the guardian can’t run off with it. If you don’t provide for the trust, the court will. You may or may not want the guardian to also be the trustee—the trustee should be someone you trust to make good investment decisions. Among other things, you can specify if the child will receive unspent trust funds at age 18, or maybe a few years later when they are more mature. You may want to put everything into a living trust instead.   You can use the will to nominate a guardian. I say “nominate” because it is not completely binding. Ultimately, the court will decide, based on what is in the best interests of the child. It is rare that the court will go against the parents’ wishes, though.   You should nominate a primary and backup guardian. The primary may develop a medical condition that means they can no longer care for children. They may take up a new profession, such as Buddhist monk or prison inmate. They may move to Botswana. (You need a backup executor for the same reason.)  While you are setting up wills, you should also have the attorney prepare [Advance Directives](https://hhs.texas.gov/laws-regulations/forms/advance-directives). This names someone to make healthcare decisions for you if you are incapacitated and sets out your healthcare wishes, especially for life support and end-of-life decisions (This part is often called a “living will.”). You can, if you want, give your agent immediate authority. They can’t overrule your wishes as long as you are competent but it allows them to talk to healthcare providers without you needing to be present to give consent. For example, to pick up a prescription and talk to the pharmacist, or call an advice nurse for you. Again you need a primary and backup agent. You can set it up so only your spouse has immediate rights.  You can also prepare a document that sets out your wishes for what the law calls “disposition of remains.”  Funeral, burial/cremation, etc.    If you don’t have an Advance Directive or funeral document, the decision maker is set by law. It may not be the person you want.",1615909615,legaladvice,gr4tg74

Section C says, If they don't, you can:  1. give notice to leave 2. get your own gas and charge the landlord the cost 3. recover money based on the lower value of the apartment 4. upon written notice, seek other housing and you can stop paying rent until it's fixed. 5. If there's imminent threat to health, you can immediately terminate your lease.  You have a lot of options, repair and deduct isn't the best here since it's so expensive to repair all of that.

For example, for Los Angeles:  &gt;*For any restaurant, you need a tax identification number, local business permit and city-issued health permit. You also need a health permit issued by the state. You must register your business with the IRS to get a number for your business to withhold payroll taxes and pay your own taxes for the business. Basic registration of your business costs between $50 and $100 in the City of Los Angeles, but there are also fees based on your estimated payroll and gross income estimates. These can range from several hundred dollars to thousands of dollars. You will need the following information to register your business: Legal Business Name, DBA Name, Start Date, Business Location, Contact Information, Sales Tax Number, IRS Number and business structure information, details of structure, owner information and Social Security numbers, answers to questions that determine your eligibility to register your business. In order to serve alcohol in Los Angeles, an operator needs to have a city Conditional Use Permit for alcoholic beverages (typically referred to as a CUB) — purchased from the city — as well as a California state Alcohol Beverage Control license. Before this new framework, the process was so difficult that restaurant operators would have to often hire specialists or lawyers to obtain permits, adding to costs and further straining small businesses.*  Separately is the corporate entity you want to create.

But Texas allows an employer to take a ""tip credit"".    Texas has no minimum wage, so they adopt the Federal rules of $7.25 minimum wage and $5.12 per hour tip credit.    Your employer can reduce your wages by the amount of tips you receive, by up to $5.12 per hour, as long as the net result is at least minimum wage.  It's a narrow question about whether you're a ""tipped employee"" against whose wages the employer can take a tip credit.   Tipped employees are defined as those in customer-facing jobs (yes) who customarily receive tips (yes) of more than $30 per week average (probably).  The strictly correct way for your employer to implement a ""no tipping"" policy with the effect they want is to have you account for them at end of shift, and pocket them, then deduct that amount from their minimum wage obligation on your wage statement.   Functionally they're doing the same thing by requiring you to add the ""keep the change"" tips to the drawer.

She also kept telling me to go faster that morning and not to fully open the boxes before reaching in (In order to go faster) and this led to me getting pricked by something in a biohazard box (I did report this, but not what the lady was doing) In the afternoon she said that thing about reporting her again, so I did.

Massachusetts follows the principle of ""abatement ab initio"", which wipes away all criminal convictions that a person has been unable to appeal when they die.   He was widely reported to have been ""declared innocent"", because the presumption of innocence returned to him when he died mid-appeal.  The prosecutors appealed the vacating of that conviction, which went all the way to the MA Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court upheld that appeal (of the motion to vacate), and in doing so eliminated that archaic legal principle for all future cases.

What is your problem against broiler plate language? That's often times a requirement that very specific language has to be used to effectuate either the execution of your will or a devise within the will itself. Look up the distinction of the term, ""issue"" if you want an example and how using that term over ""heirs.""  That's just one example of how a term can totally affect the way your estate is disbursed.   I'm always of the opinion that paying a lawyer to do your will is the best course of action. Lawyers know these words. They know how to craft your will in a way that will effectuate your desires.  The price of wills scale. A relatively simple one will only cost you a few hundred dollars. A complicated will can cost you much more. But either price is well worth it to the get the assurance that it was drafted pursuant to the laws of your state. You're also not just paying for the lawyer to draft it. You're getting it executed properly as well. That requires witnesses and notaries, all provided for you right there in the lawyer's office. They are also the best witnesses for your will because they know what they have witnessed and know how to explain that to a court if it ever came to that. Your lawyer also acts a witness to your testamentary wishes. You have all that built in the price of the will.   Think about how much you own and how you want it to be disbursed. Now think about if the cost of the will was $1,000.00. How much of a fraction of your entire estate is that? Now imagine one for $300.00.

7868,9514,"Here is the issue. You're dealing with two different things that are intertwined: (1) the acceptance of your transition and (2) dealing with your mental health issues. Under the law, your parents don't have to be accepting of your transition. They can not agree to it. They can continue to call you by your legal name. They can not agree to allow you to get medical treatment for it. Your mental health issues are different. While they still largely have the ability to govern the treatment of your mental health, they can't do it in a way that will harm you and CPS may intervene if it gets to that point. Herein lies the problem, how do we successfully disentangle what your parents can legally do from what they can't? In shades of grey like this, it usually takes a stark contrast for CPS to step in and do something. So, if your mental health gets to the point where your life and safety is in danger they may intervene. The problem also with that is that if it gets to the point where your life and safety is in that much danger that they got involved, you are likely going to be put in some very restrictive treatment. CPS doesn't have the ability to have discretion like the parents do. They are a government agency and have to follow strict laws, rules, regulations, and agency policy.   I know this isn't much help in your current situation, but I hope it lays out the legal roadmap you have before you and helps you to focus on your mental health with your parents rather than the transition as it is the one issue that may get you some traction.",1615903095,legaladvice,gr4ffnv

Unfortunately, if you tell the LL you won't pay the difference between $45 and what she's billed she may make your tenancy difficult. Though it's possible she'll do that regardless.  A few points to consider. If the bill was $60 would she have complained and demanded you pay $15? Unless she's shared a year of past billing statements you don't even know if she's being honest about the prior tenant's usage. If the bill isn't in your name and she's not providing it you can't be sure she's being honest and will continue to be honest and you don't have direct access to daily/hourly usage data which may be available and allow you to make informed decisions to reduce the electrical expense.   You could use this as an opportunity to negotiate for something that will benefit you. For example capping  all future rent increases at 2% per year and her giving you an additional 30 days notice if she doesn't intend to renew - all in writing. If it was me, I'd ask for 12 months of electrical bills to review. Then I might state that upon receipt of future bills I'll pay for anything over $75 (not $45) or for the service to be put in my name and to receive a monthly rent credit for $75, but here's what I'd like in return.

7918,9579,"First, I wouldn't resign. Resigning is considered a voluntary quit and it makes it harder to access things like unemployment. In terms of your FMLA, you claim you are diagnosed with a few anxiety disorders. This may be considered a disability. Were they ever made aware of you having anxiety or being diagnosed? Asking for a smaller class size, similar to other teachers in the same age group is fine. Additionally, with COVID-19 it is normal for you to be concerned about class size if in person. This may be considered requesting a reasonable accommodation due to anxiety, especially if other teachers had smaller class sizes.  Now, in terms of them not renewing your contract. They are certainly within their rights if they had't been treating you differently, but you claim that they are. That the principal in a way has been harassing and discriminating against you, and doing things that he doesn't do with the other teachers. This is where it is good to collect evidence. With you going on leave, that is going to be much more difficult unless you think you have enough already to convince an attorney that you were discriminated against, in which case they would subpoena for more evidence. If all else, maybe you could try when you return.  In these situations union reps, HR, superintendents aren't there to help you. I know, you think a union is there for the employees but they are mostly there as an organization that represents the company's relationship with the employees as a whole. Sometimes they'll step in, but usually it is when they see an opportunity for the union.  It is hard to say if you have enough evidence for a retaliation claim, but you can always report it to the EEOC and they'll eventually either give you a Right to Sue letter or not. Additionally, you could meet with an attorney that specializes in workplace discrimination and retaliation. Usually they are contingency based and will give a free consultation. If they think you have a strong case, then usually they'll offer to take the case on contingency. If they don't, then they are usually pretty upfront. Just because they say no though doesn't mean you don't have a case, just sometimes it is more difficult.

One was a knee high street sign that was set in grass and was used by local kids who were noisy and using the area as a toilet. I larded up the sign at night and there was nowhere they could sit anymore so they moved on. Second place was a street corner with a waist high brick wall across the road from me, where again noisy kids thought it was a good place to congregate. I larded up the top and edge of the wall. Problem disappeared again.  I was asked for advice from people living in a passageway that only served a few houses - but not really used by those who lived there. Lard on the wooden fence resolved their problem overnight as the kids had nothing to lean on - and kids like to lean on something.  Use pure unadulterated lard. Not fat with ""extra ingredients"". Lard will wash out without leaving a stain. It will also oxidise in air and sunlight and literally vanish all on its own without leaving a trace.  ""You can get sued for damaging clothing"".

Don't be surprised if the local police bump this up to the federal level and he gets a call from either the FBI or US Secret Service.  Since CG probably used a brokerage outside of Pennsylvania, the Feds will have jurisdiction and both the FBI and USSS investigate financial crimes.  If your FoF wants to really jump start all of this, I would have them contact the local FBI field office as well as the local police.

This was after an ex that I shared two kids with took our kids across country after a breakup.  When you have a child, the most important thing to always consider is what is best for the child. Unless you're a terrible human being that shouldn't be around kids, then I don't see how you could justify her taking your child like that. Just because she was apparently a good mom while you were together, doesn't mean that she will be a good mom forever or that whoever she involves herself with will be a good role model.  So, you need to decide right now if you want to actually be able to be involved in your kids life. If so, let the lawyers do their thing. Prepare yourself in your job and schooling to allow time for this case, and you possible getting full custody for a while.  Reach out to friends and family for support. Hold on to any empathy that you may have for your wife until after the case is over. Don't let empathy cloud your judgement during the legal process. It is best to have a court order with more than what you asked for so that you can compromise on your terms later.  I see the likely conclusion of her being given the option to return with the child or without. International cases like this can be very expensive. Try to save as much as possible.

8066,9754,"Eviction is a court process. Simply giving you a letter an not filing the court paperwork doesn't really do a lot of good. If the eviction notice he gave you had a forged signature, then yes I guess he could run into issues if you can prove that it is forged and whoever he signed for states that they didn't give him permission and they want to pursue charges or sue them. Since your cousin claims to be power of attorney, which is a legal document as well, it may be limited to specific matters. Regardless, to actually evict you there will be a court hearing and the court would have him prove that he is authorized to act on behalf of the property owner to evict you.  As the person who was given an eviction notice, it doesn't matter if it was mailed to you or not. It was handed to you which is considered valid service. If your uncle does have control over medical and this was given to him during the early stages of Alzheimers, but it has since progressed to where your grandma is no longer able to make changes, then he may use the court (or may have already) to try to get full conservatorship if he can prove that your cousin isn't fulfilling his obligation by acting in her best interests. Letting an adult non-child live somewhere for free may actually be considered not to be in her best interest, especially if she could be renting the property for a descent amount.  However, one thing to note is with COVID-19 many states including CA have an eviction moratorium that applies in certain circumstances. You may be protected by that, but I don't know enough about it.

However, if you’re interested, i think it would be easier to get a Mexican passport than a Mexican voting ID since the Instituto Nacional Electoral is pretty much focusing on getting everything ready for the next elections.  [THIS](https://www.gob.mx/tramites/ficha/pasaporte-ordinario-para-personas-mayores-de-edad/SRE112) is the official page of the Mexican government which describes all the documents you need to get a passport and again, doesn’t say that you can’t get one because of the military service. However it’s required to have a Mexican birth certificate or any other documents that prove you’re Mexican.   Overall, my suggestion is calling your airline and asking them about the required documents you might need to travel inside of Mexico. I’ve always shown either my passport or ID but since you don’t have any legal way to prove you’re Mexican, things get complicated and you might not even be able to travel at all.

Everything scientifically and traditionally has proven redundantly that children do far better in every stage and age of their life when they are raised in close contact (at the least) with their natural parents. It’s not personal, it’s not going against the righteous actions you have demonstrated and by doing so you don’t have to fear you will no longer be important to her. That bond is there, it’s formed... it’s something your sister has most likely been tortured by grief for the last four years because she has been without....with her own self to blame. Sense you have said yourself you are the one who has been acting and providing everything for her. Why would you limit that to something as gravely important to two people as the loving relationship between them is? Part of being a mommy is loving so much you have no bias to the life they live so long as it’s healthy and happy. Absolutely you should have a serious conversation with your sister about boundaries and what she has to commit to. Which is pretty likely something she is not ready to do yet if she has just been released. There’s nothing wrong with her earning her clean time and life back slowly because who just gets released and has all the resources and decision making abilities necessary to safely be able to jump in a life of full time mommy and employee and law abiding citizen? That is a lot for anyone, it’s a setup for failure. She obviously is not even able to see that , her maternal instincts are impulsive. You have such a privileged position in this whole situation. No one is asking you to give your daughter away, but I am asking you to consider all of the positives you are capable of blessing your family with..... change the perspective mayybe. Do what you want your daughter to be proud of you for and eliminate the idea you have any right to judge or keep tabs on the struggles your sister has had.

What may happen next i that they raise their voices and say things like ""You have no rights at the border"" and ""We'll keep you here until you answer."" Those are bluffs.  They may ask you to unlock your phone (you can refuse to do that). They might also pat you down. But they WILL let you into the USA even if you refuse to answer questions.   Refusal to answer might mean that they flag for secondary inspection next time, but it sounds like you're flagged anyway.  You have every right to tell them ""I'm not answering anything, I'll see you here next time and I won't answer any questions then either and there's nothing you can do about it. If you have grounds to arrest me then put the handcuffs on me and take me into custody. If not, let me go. I'm American.

Is there a way I can check what are they looking into me and what information and why are they collecting?  You can make a FOIA request, and you'll get an response in about a year that will include the officers' narratives about your secondary inspections. They will probably be heavily redacted. You can then appeal that and ask for the full reports and you might get a little more info.   You have no obligation to otherwise ""cooperate"" other than making your bags available for inspection.

You can't be evicted unless you're in violation of your lease, and it's a whole process.  You generally can't be evicted without a court hearing where your LL has to convince a judge that you're violating the lease.  If you lose at the hearing, LL gets an eviction order and then you get the boot.  Anything else is an illegal eviction and you should call the cops to force your LL to let you back into your house.  Keep some copies of your lease somewhere other than your house in case he tries this.  The most important thing here is going to be keeping all your ducks in a row so he either actually fixes the problem, or you get out of there without an eviction or any record of or penalty for breaking the lease.  You're following the process to a T so he can't succeed in damaging your credit by the end of this.  Good night and good luck.",1615875449,legaladvice,gr3hvze
